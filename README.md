# Not ready 

## Annotation

> It's hard to be an ambassador to an alien civilization when you're just ten.
> And much less qualified than your partner, a spy for a rivaling superpower.
> 
> A battle of wits with an advanced alien race,
> blood-boiling gunfights, budding romance, powerful villains,
> one twisted maze of a plot and a well-earned triumph â€”
> in this book you'll find none of that crap and even less.
> 
> Instead, brace yourself
> for the hard work of deciphering alien intentions to go downhill
> in an absurd dystopian world where the Space Race never ended,
> everyone is well-intentioned, and competence is dead.
> But hey, you don't dwell on the negative when you're ten.

## What is it?

I was playing a game with my wife. I decided to transcribe it, and here it is.
This is my first attempt at [writing fiction],
so I can't say for sure what is it.
A novelized tabletop roleplaying game transcript?

## Q&A

### I don't like your PDFs, where are the other formats?
EPUB: [en.epub], [ru.epub] \
FictionBook: [en.fb2], [ru.fb2] \
Text wrapped to 80 columns: [en.80column.txt], [ru.80column.txt] \
Text not wrapped to 80 columns: [en.freeflow.txt], [ru.freeflow.txt] \
Note that these are UNTESTED, I just hope they are readable.
If all else fails, you can read the source Markdown.

### No, where are the good formats?
IDK, contribute one?

### I happen to know both languages
Nice!

<details><summary>But which one is the translation?</summary>
Both are, sort of. The game took place mostly in Russian.
The original draft, for the most part,
was mixed-language direct speech with English narration.

<details><summary>No, which one should I read?</summary>
Look, I also build en-ru.interleaved.pdf that offers both, side by side.
Try both and see which one sticks?
