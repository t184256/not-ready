# (Not) entrusted

The phone was missing altogether, as was the night stand.
Even without a clock, it was clear as day though:
the resurrection threw Grip's struggling sleep pattern out of the window.

He picked the suit from the footboard and trudged to the shower
to come to senses, change into clean clothes and
wash off that deadly substance that could be anywhere.
On his way back Grip peeked into the canteen.
Irakli Kosmovich put down the tube and smiled back.
"*Banana?*"
"*Good morning. Banana.*"
"*Banana!*"
Grip dove into the drawer, fetching a yellow one for himself.
"*Guess we'll have to do powers again...*" Irakli stated.
"*... algebra?*"
"*Yeah, algebra.*"
"*Give me, like, fifteen minutes? Who knows what extra paperwork awaits me.*"
"*What's Derevyashko here for, if not paperwork?*" Irakli grunted.
 "*Make him do it for you.*"
Grip left uplifted and content.

He tiptoed into his previous room to carefully pick up the phone,
full to the brim with documents Maria has forwarded.
Here's a wall of text in incomprehensible English...
here's a shorter one, with highlights and comments.
Grip reluctantly turned the translator on and frowned,
toggling it back and forth...

> *... has discovered well-studied, understudied and unknown microorganisms
> (M. Stinner: same as the last scan, for you and Thalia alike)
> incapable of inducing a sustained autoimmune reaction.*

> *Reverse simulation of the early stage of the autoimmune reaction
>  suggests an asymmetric development profile with the origin tracing back
>  to the left ear, left nostril or one of the root canals.*

> *Identification, synthesis and reintroduction
>  largely confirms the originally defined symptomatology.*

> *Suggested effect under immune suppression (simulated):
>  neural inhibition (M. Stinner: of what?) of low intensity.
>  Onset symptoms: fatigue, constipation, drowsiness.*

The next report was impenetrable even with the translator.
Grip gave up after it dawned on him
that the titular "agent" referred to neither him nor the poison,
but some other substance with an unpronounceable mess for a name.

The string of forwarded documents was topped off with a message:
@"come to the lab, I'll explain it".
An offer Grip gladly took.

He managed to catch a glimpse of something disorienting
bright red and green-- must've been false colours --on Maria's screen
before she noticed him and flinched the picture close.
The cage wasn't there.

"How're you feeling?"
"Fatigued, drowsy, not constipated," Grip flaunted new words at her.
"So, you've read that one already," she smiled, amused.
 "Have you understood the rest?"
"Almost nothing, to be honest."
"It's simple, really.
 That thing you've overreacted to the day before
 is otherwise harmless for you, almost certainly harmless..."
Dmytro Ivanovich appeared at the door frame.
Grip waved at him, and so did Maria.
"... whom it does affect though, is lizards,
 but the effect is a rather mild one.
 Like, two glasses of wine would have on him,"
 she tilted her head at Derevyashko:
 "A long shot from being lethal."
She let out a string of impressive-sounding terms that...
probably described the effect on wine on adults, in scientific English?
"Local lizards?" Grip nodded as if he understood it all.
"Of course."

Derevyashko stepped closer,
moved by the scientific mini-convent unfolding in front of him.
"We haven't figured out-- largely, because we haven't done much at all --where
 have you managed to run into it.
 Could you breathe it in with the local air?"
"Huh?"
"Have you ventured outside without your suit on?"
"Why?.. Although... I can't be sure, I..."
"???"
"... don't remember, like, a day and a half?"
"Oh," Maria accepted the argument.
 "Right. I should be asking Thalia. Although, she would've mentioned that.
  Anyway, about these reports.
  They still haven't told me how typical the response is,
  but they've sent in the first targeted suppressant."
"Suppressant?"
"I inject it, you stop reacting so violently.
 To that thing, and millions of other ones, but not all of them."
Grip wasn't comfortable with her holding something back.
"... Thanks, but, you said there will be a better one?
 I think I'll wait for a better one."
"As you wish. Worst case, we print another you," Maria answered calmly.
"So, was he the only test subject so far?" Dmytro Ivanovich asked offhandedly.
"Wait, was it tested on me?"
"Yeah, that's what I said."
"They've printed more copies of me? Just to test this thing?"
"Not the full copies, no.
 A brain and some spine should suffice, shouldn't they?"
 Derevyashko looked at Maria, expecting a confirmation.
 "Sure there's no use in printing legs to test the neuroimmune response."
Maria stared at him disapprovingly, but did not object.
"So, any ideas where you caught it?"
"No, nobody mentioned any new substances. Besides, how would I know?
 If it's microscopic--"
"It sure is," Maria interjected. "Scanning the cage takes ages."
"Good, because when our gecko ran away last night--"
"Have you let it out?" Derevyashko inquired.
"Yeah."
"What for?" Maria went nervous.
"The oth-- the ambassador wanted to touch it."
"Good cosmos, touch it?"
"Yes... that's why we asked for a lizard!
 He wanted to touch a fish, but couldn't."
Maria grabbed her head.
"Has it?"
"What?"
"Touched it. Have you seen them come into contact?"
"No, I was here. When I came to the dome last night, it was in the cage."
"Why though? I should've thought that scenario through..."
"Why not? It's harmless, isn't it? Unlike that fish-- have you seen its teeth?
 We need to keep him interested, that's why we're here".
This explanation calmed Maria down a notch,
but made Derevyashko tense up and frown.
"Do not put the health of... the ambassador... at risk,"
 Maria told Grip off with her energy evaporating as she spoke.
 "What am I gonna do then? Please, just don't," she almost begged him.
"Oh, have I told you about that time our ambassador decided to fall down?"
"What? No," Dmytro Ivanovich leaned closer.
Maria's emotional rollercoaster ran out of energy,
so she just stared at them with distrust and disapproval.
"So, we come in, and instead of just coming in from their side,
 like he always does, he falls from above! On Thalia's head!
 She jumps around, starts running, I take him off,
 and he's like, 'isn't it fun?'. It sure wasn't for her!"
"Fun? Do they even have a word for 'fun'?"
"Oh, trust me, he was having fun. You should have seen his face."
"And, forgive me for asking, but where exactly can I find this in your reports?"
"Forgiven. And, I'm, like, explaining to him that he can get hurt this way,
 and he's all: 'no, I'm strong'.
 I spent, like, half an hour explaining that the floor is hard,
 and it's gonna... get injured."
"I'm serious, Grip, we need this kind of things reported.
 Half an hour, and not a single word?"
"That's what happens when you recruit a *valenok*," Grip parried.
 "OK, OK, next time I will write it."
Derevyashko's expression made it clear that joking is not an answer,
and he'll remember that.

"So, if something happens to Newt, it's because of our lizard. Noted,"
 Maria mumbled, staring at the corner of the room.
Grip followed her gaze to a "jar" with the lizard, immobile.
OK, not really a jar. It was more horizontal than vertical,
yet still not long enough for it to stretch the tail out.
"That's our--?"
"Yeah."
Grip knocked on the glass, the lizard rolled its eyes towards him.
"Is it alright?"
"Yeah. Maybe slightly cold."
"They like heat, right? Like, outside?"
"That's why we picked it, remember? Don't expect much activity from it."
"Understood. No songs then."
"Songs?"
"After those glasses of wine."
"It really isn't obvious when you're joking,
 and when it's just your normal chaos going on," Dmytro Ivanovich complained.
"You got it all wrong, it's the local ones who--" Maria began.

Grip spotted Thalia in the hallway.
"Good morning! How are your knees?"
"I'll be fine," she intoned dismissively.
Again, it was impossible to tell through the suit.
"I was telling them how you were catching the lizard,"
 Grip continued. "But you were there, so you can tell it better."
"He's also told us how you got ambushed from above," Derevyashko interjected.
 "Has that really happened?"
"Of course it has. It's all there in my reports."
"And what do you think he was after?" Derevyashko asked.
"Me? I think he's acting stupid. He's a kid."
Grip nodded along in agreement.
"Grip said he wanted to touch our lizard--" Maria continued.
"--and the fish--"
"--has it?"
"No. I'm pretty sure he hasn't.
 When I've put it out, it ran away.
 When we've put it back, Newt helped, but from a distance."
"I expected better from you than to set up a lizard fight,"
 Maria was disappointed.
"Fight? There was no fight. A chase, merely. Nobody touched anyone."
"Well, we had," Grip objected.
"We've been doing it all the time and it was fine.
 It was his idea to climb you."
"And falling on you."
"That sure wasn't my idea. If he misses next time, that's on him."
"Hope you'll make him refrain from falling onto hard flooring.
 Failure to do so could mark the downfall of your diplomatic mission."
 Maria said dryly.
"Grip was rather clear about it,"
 Thalia knocked on the table, smiling, and noticed the lizard.
"How did he do that anyway? Where would they practice?"
"They must be falling at each other from those cacti I keep hearing about,"
 Derevyashko suggested.
Maria winced and refrained from commenting.
"If our strong friend doesn't want to become flat, he'd think better next time,"
 Grip summarized.

"Why is it here?" Thalia pointed at a lizard in a jar.
"I'm still scanning the cage," Maria replied.
"Tell me when you're done," Grip asked.
"Sure."
"OK, and I think...
 *I'm gonna leave now, fill the gaps in my algebra knowledge.*"

Derevyashko wasn't done though:
"Grip came up with a curious theory last night," he began.
 "That lizards themselves aren't sentient,
  it's mushrooms in their brains that are."
"--yeah, Miyamoto's hypothesis," Maria nodded.
Grip buried his face in his hands, while she continued:
"Explains why some lizards are sentient and some are not and... not much more.
 Unless you've found new evidence that backs..."
She trailed off, as Grip gave her a confused look,
and started all over, slower:
"Like, what's our issue with lizards being sentient? It's twofold:
 how come lizards are sentient,
 and how come only some lizards are sentient.
 Mushrooms, if we were to discover them, would answer the second question,
 but exacerbate the first-- make it worse and raise some more,
 --because now we'll have to explain sentient mushrooms.
 It's bad enough that lizards have small brains and,
 seemingly, no big problems to solve.
 Mushrooms would be even smaller--"
"Mushrooms are large, actually," Grip objected with vigor.
 "Mushrooms are all connected underground, so they are actually one large--"
"They sure are, but are lizards connected?"
"Like, do they?... Have telepathy?"
"I mean, everything's possible. I don't know. Ask them."
 Maria decided to have some mercy on his theory.
 "Professor Miyamoto's hypothesis wasn't actually about mushrooms...
  Mushrooms are a bad fit, anyway."
"But can they? Grow in brains? I've read that they can."
"Yes, they can, but their... uh...
 see, mushrooms aren't exactly famous for their folklore,
 geometry knowledge or analytical abilities.
 Until you've got facts to back it,
 that theory raises so many new questions, while answering just one,
 so forgive me for sticking to the plain bland multispecies theory:
 brainier lizards living among their distant non-sentient relatives."
"So, that makes us the aliens struggling to tell humans apart from monkeys?"
 Dmytro Ivanovich nodded.
"Homo sapiens from all the other homo."
"Easy, humans live in cities," Thalia remarked.
"Lizards don't have to live separately."
"How is that a problem," Grip mumbled absentmindedly.
 "Lizards have tails and we don't. Can I go now?"
"I won't delay you any further, professor Miyamoto,"
 Derevyashko mixed mockery with respect.

Thalia tagged along.
"*I'll come to you, but later,*" Grip said. "*We've got no plan, nothing.*"
"*Just a ball,*" she muttered and took a right turn shortly after.

Grip finally came to study powers for the second time.
Irakli Kosmovich dug the phone out of the paper piles,
explained what do the cutesy small digits mean, and
they ran through the problems he already had at hand.
Once Grip made a mistake, Irakli Kosmovich paused to compose a similar example,
and that was when the hangar filled with an emotional, heartfelt "HELGA!".
They both flinched and exchanged glances.
Then a second, more directed and demanding call filled the air again:
 "Helga Voronov!"
"*I need to go-- I need a break, my colleague clearly has--*"
"*Yeah, --sure, of course-- go check it out...*"
Grip dashed to the lab, his phone flashing in his hand.

Thalia stood by the table, cowering before Maria overhanging her:
"You thought I wouldn't notice? How did that even happen? Come in, Grip,"
 she greeted him in a voice that didn't promise anything pleasant.
"What happened?"
"Yeah, what happened?" Derevyashko echoed from behind.
"The cage is choke full of scales!"
"Of what?" Grip asked.
"Loose... skin of local lizards. Maybe you can tell us about it?"
"Is it... does sand normally have it?"
"Yes," Maria lowered her tone. "But not in such quantities."
"... Mary--" Thalia began softly.
"Don't you 'Mary' me now, not this time. How did it-- you.
 You said you let the lizard out. Have you put Newt inside?"
"I don't see the problem. Sand has more skin than usual, so what?"
 Grip shrugged.
 "Have you found the poison thing in it?"
"Not yet. Hasn't finished scanning yet.
 But if I'm gonna discover something else there, better tell me right away."
Thalia was looking at Grip, defeated.

"It's not funny, Grip," Dmytro Ivanovich broke the silence.
 "You two are obviously hiding something."
"Do I understand it right? That the main goal of our mission
 is to continue our contacts with the lizards?" Grip spoke slowly.
"Precisely."
"Then everything must stay the way it is now."

Maria slumped a little.
"You've brought it here," she spilled her overflowing disappointment.
Thalia let out a quiet sigh.
"The success of our mission depends on how quiet this room will be,"
 Grip insisted.
He turned back to look at Derevyashko and
caught a glimpse of Stalina guarding the exit on the outside.
"If it told you not to tell us... how did it know..."
 Maria muttered under her breath.
"Why did you do this?" Derevyashko acted curious and oblivious to the tension.
"It's not like we have any secrets," Thalia commented.
Everybody ignored her.
"It was a test... for us..." Grip replied.
"A test for what?" he frowned, curious.
"For idiocy. We've passed."
Dmytro Ivanovich chortled.
"We're sure it's like us. Young. Careless.
 If we also weren't like this, it wouldn't talk to us."
Maria nodded along to what was, probably, her own thoughts.
"We couldn't ask for your approval and risk it all," Grip continued.
"So, it has dared you?" Derevyashko summed it up.
"It was a planned operation," Grip feigned confidence.
Derevyashko sent a brief glance towards Stalina lurking out of sight.

"So it was here that night,"
 Maria massaged her temples, stomaching the realization.
 "Have you let him out? Even for a brief moment?"
Grip and Thalia shook their heads in unison:
"No."
"How would you know if you--" Maria pressed Grip.
"--I know myself. I would never do it."
"To protect Newt?"
"Yes, also that.
 He thinks he's strong, but what if Irakli Kosmovich steps on him?"
"How did he even agree to come on board," Derevyashko wondered.
 "If they're so afraid of mechanisms?"
"It was his idea," Thalia objected.
"And you brought him in--"
"I'm sorry," Thalia addressed Grip.
 "We've messed it up.
  I was tired, I... didn't think it through... that Maria would bust us."
"Doesn't matter now," Grip nodded briefly.
 "I believe it's more important to find out where did the poison come from.
  And if now I'll have to write a long report explaining why we did it, I can.
  I've been thinking about this a lot."
"Oh, please oblige," Derevyashko nodded. "I'm not writing that one for you."

Maria sat down and leaned back. The silence dragged on.
"Formally speaking..." Derevyashko spoke up.
 "Has it helped or hindered the mission?"
"Helped."
"Certainly?"
"Without a doubt."
"Even if you tell him that we know now?"
"That's why I asked you to be quiet!"
"You know we know."
"But I haven't told you," Grip insisted.
"Now that's something for you to sort out, you're the diplomat."
Grip shrugged, irritated.
"OK. Go back to your studies--"
"--I'd rather--"
"--then write me that report you've just promised."
"Yeah, OK. I guess. I'm too emotional anyway."

Derevyashko and Stalina went the other way.
Grip could make out a bit of Dmytro Ivanovich addressing her:
"*And the strangest part is that the strat--*"

"*What was that? You rascals got into some mischief?...*"
 Irakli Kosmovich asked, fumbling for the phone again.
"*A little...*"
"*Oh. Well, it's always been mighty hectic here,
 and you kids made it into one lovely circus.*"
"*... I'm afraid Thalia will get in trouble for this mischief.
  When it was mostly mine to begin with.*"
"*Should I know more?*"
"*Nah, nah, no details. Just my distress talking.*"
"*Must be tough, with your superior on-site...
  OK, not my circus, not my lizards. Let's get maths out of your way.*"

Somehow Grip ended up listening about phonetic patterns of word loaning.
None of that seemed applicable to humans and lizards,
but Grip found it interesting nonetheless,
because he found algebra predetermined and boring in comparison.
Yet all good things come to an end.
"*Enough for today, guess you have that mischief of yours to deal with.*"
"*True.*"
"*What are we gonna do next time? I also have to prepare.*"
"*Drawing?*"
"*What, drawing? I... huh.
  Do I even have to prepare for that, or will you just sit here and draw?*
"*Forget it then, how about physics?*"
"*Sure, why not? Physics it is. Deal.*"

Grip left to his new room to agonize over
what naturally gravitated towards an incident report:

> *I, Grip Avdotievich Stavropolskiy,
>  have smuggled a representative of an alien civilization onboard.
>  The ambassador has expressed his desire to visit our crew quarters.
>  The envoy has made himself clear that we were not allowed to
>  notify any of the other crew members of this excursion.
>  Said desire has been expressed
>  unequivocally, unambiguously and uncompromisingly,
>  leaving no possibility to continue the diplomatic relationship
>  outside of satisfying the request.*
>
> *Due to this, I've started to plan out the details of excursion
>  and discuss it with my colleague Helga Voronov,
>  as she was a more experienced agent,
>  and I wanted to ensure the maximum possible safety
>  for all the parties involved.
>  We've designed a chamber ensuring the safety of the ambassador
>  by ruling out physical contact with anything but the contents of it
>  over the course of the entire presence onboard.
>  We've picked a fitting animal to swap with the envoy.
>  The ambassador's presence onboard has lasted for one day...
>  The chamber has been placed in my room and hasn't left it until
>  the next evening, when my colleague and my immediate superior
>  have transported it back to the dome, an activity I could not partake in
>  due to a recent incident in the living quarters leading to my demise.*
>
> *So from here on, the described events will be told from the words of
>  my colleague who performed the reverse swapping.
>  The swapping was successful and incident-free,
>  the ambassador was satisfied with the whole ordeal,
>  thus ensuring and bolstering our communication going forward.
>  Moreover, our biologist Maria Stinner
>  has acquired some biological material from the ambassador
>  that she can study now.*

Grip re-read the result,
backtracked to the "reverse swapping" bit, left a gap with a note:

> *what Thalia told me: Newt got out, helped catch lizard, drank*

And slotted in the following:

> *I've joined them after the swapping has already been completed.
>  After ensuring that the ambassador is content with the trip,
>  I've helped transport the chamber back to the base
>  together with its original inhabitant,
>  and handed it over to our biologist Maria,
>  where scanning has revealed the fact of the infiltration
>  I'm describing in this report.*
>
> *I believe this report should be classified,
>  as the ambassador has requested the infiltration to remain secret,
>  and every new person reading this increases the risk of sabotaging our
>  diplomatic effort as a whole.*

He then began editing the next paragraph to make it blend,
transplanted the classification notice to the bottom, moved the note further up,
and that's when he got another "come to the lab" from Maria,
perfectly echoing her previous "come to the lab"
and the "come to the lab, I'll explain it" before that one.
No shouting this time though.

For the third time today they convened in the tiny lab.
Maria demonstrated Thalia a familiar dotted pattern,
but with two vertical green lines overlaid on top of it.
"... and back. Look."
"What am I looking at?" Grip asked.
Maria zoomed out and tilted the camera to reveal the entire cage.
"Trace of what?" Derevyashko inquired from behind in a cheerful, curious voice.
 "DNA?"
"A bit of organics; nope."
"That's the outer side?"
"Here's the inside."
She sent the viewpoint spinning around the cage's shorter wall
until it crossed into the cage, and the other side looked very much the same:
a gradient-meshed wall bore two almost straight vertical green lines.
"Which one is that? Of the two sides," Thalia spoke up in a tense quiet voice.
"The last one to scan, but it's symmetric. Maybe you can remember."
"Is it all the way through the wall? This trace," Grip pointed at it.
"No-no-no," she sent the camera spinning again.
 "These are surface traces. I can even tell you which one is which, mm...
  This one's crawling in and this one's for crawling out."
"Crawling in?"
"And out."
"It was him," Thalia exhaled bitterly. "It was him after all."
Grip groaned quietly.
"Congratulations, professor Miyamoto,"
 Derevyashko announced without a trace of encouragement in his voice.
 "Case closed."
"Why are you staring at me like that," Grip addressed Thalia.
 "I'm reprinted, remember?"
"Indeed you are," she nodded with caution.
"You're the dangerous one! Out of the two of us--"
"--That's some exemplary diplomacy you're carrying out," Maria interrupted him.
 "Day three-- no, day four, --and one of them kills one of us."
"He didn't want to! Because that's super stupid!" Grip insisted.
"You abducted one of them, remember?" Derevyashko looked up from his phone.
"We--"
"Wasn't me though," Maria countered. "That was before the contact."
"You are writing that report, aren't you?" he asked Grip.
"I am," Grip nodded.
"Send it to me as is right now. And start writing a new one."
"He can't. It's almost dawn," Thalia stated matter-of-factly.
Grip obliged, hit "Send", heard Dmytro Ivanovich's phone tick.
"We need to go," she insisted.

"New ground rule, kids. Nobody's killing anyone. OK?" Maria was bitter.
 "... And by the way, I've found nothing dangerous in that cage."
"I didn't plan to kill anyone," Grip stated.
"Then try not to die," Stalina replied from the hallway.
"Sure," Grip nodded.
"Listen," Thalia addressed Maria.
 "When he fell onto me, do you think he was trying to--?"
"No. I'm sure he wasn't," Grip replied.
"Why?"
"If that's how it's done, if it's, ugh, crawling in and out, that's not quick.
 It can't just attack you from a distance, it's a... slow process, I guess.
 Leave the body. Settle in, maybe--"
"--it could infect me and keep running around. And I won't--"
"--two tracks, see?" Maria pointed at the screen again. "He came back--"
"--I don't think it infected you, yeah," Grip continued.
 "It could try its anae--... freeze you, for example, or what does it do--"
"--nothing," Maria interjected. "it does nothing--"
"--to humans, yes, but, I mean, lizards. He wasn't trying to kill you."
"How do I protect from it, what do I do?" Thalia pressed Maria.
"Cover your nostrils, ears and mouth?" she suggested.
"That sure won't be suspicious. Especially mouth," Grip laughed nervously.
"Keep in mind that it might kick in only an hour later. Shower thoroughly.
 Oh, yeah, it's also not unique to Grip."
"Is there a vaccine?"
Who knew Thalia's face could get even more pale?
"Not a great one."
"Tested on?..."
"Just Grip."
"So you're already..." she turned to him.
"No, I... Several hours ago I still had a choice. To wait or to vaccinate."
"And what's your choice now?" Maria asked in a tired voice.
"... Honestly, I don't think it'll happen again. I'd wait.
 I'm more afraid I'll bring this on board--"
"--It's not an infection, remember?"
"Yes, and? Doesn't make it better."
"We won't go mad and die all at once."
"Still, I'd rather not. I like all of you."
"So, how many do you--" Thalia began again.
"One. Grip's one."
"I want it then."
"Take it, you're a more useful specialist," Grip gladly yielded.
Maria opened the fridge, and gestured to Thalia to come along.
"When will it--"
"--four hours, give or take."
"It's already sunset!"
"I'll print more, just in case. Come here..."

"For the record, again, it's not deadly to them, is it?" Derevyashko inquired.
"It's not," Maria replied without turning away from Thalia.
"That more or less rules out intent to murder."
"I have an idea," Grip jumped. "He didn't try to kill me, just to get in.
 They tried with adults, it didn't work, so they asked for kids."
Derevyashko looked at Maria slightly shaking her head.
"I don't think so."
"Is it possible that the way... into the head... no longer works? For adults."
"Huh?" Maria disposed of the tiny syringe.
"Does something change in your head when you grow up?"
"No, why are you asking? Wait, was he interested in small animals specifically?"
"Yes, he was," Thalia confirmed grimly.
"Yes."
"They wore suits for what, half a year?" Stalina asked from the hallway.
Maria nodded.

Grip pointed at the jar:
"We didn't let him touch the fish, and it was glass and water...
 Just in case, can you scan its brain?"
"I could, when I get time for this. I'll need to freeze--"
"--They haven't touched," Thalia insisted.
"Doesn't matter! What if it hid in the cage first and then got into it?"
"Excellent thinking, pro--" Dmytro Ivanovich shut up under Grip's piercing gaze.
"Understood. Yeah," Maria grabbed the jar and headed out.
 "Actually, let me try this first..."
  she finished as she walked towards the teleports.
"*Oh well,*" Thalia murmured, staring at the floor while rubbing her neck.
"*While we're packing... we need to agree on what to tell him, cause I guess--*"
 Grip began as she glanced at him and headed out.

He followed her to the hallway.
"*I've skipped a day and a half, has he asked for anything?*"
"*No, he was... excited after an adventure. Happy, scared, maybe.
  He just wanted to go home.*"
Thalia now looked friendly, focused and thoughtful.
"*Agree on what exactly? Hiding that the adults know?*" she continued.
"*First of all, this. And in general.
  We should act as if we don't know any more than we knew yesterday.*"
"*And you didn't die, you just felt bad and then--
  ugh, I don't know to write that anyway
  --and you just rested before joining us.*"
They entered her room, adorned with white figurines and a larger aquarium.
Grip checked it out briefly.
"*Not like I know these words either,*" she continued.
 "*I don't even know how to write "die".
   But, you know what! I guess "proper" does mean "ruling" after all.
   To control. Mind control, specifically.*"
She hopped on the bed, squirmed there,
and instinctively rubbed her neck once again.
"*What'chu got there?*" Grip stepped closer.
"*What?*" she froze.
 "*Ah,*" she averted her eyes.
 "*Nothing. I put him there myself, remem-- Uh. Right behind my ears.*"
"*Maybe you just haven't scratched it right yet.*"
"*Oh, shut up.*"
"*Just kidding. Look, calm down.
  You've been OK for a long while since.
  And now you're also vaccinated.*"
She nodded and eased up a little.
"*What are these things, by the way?*" Grip changed the subject.
"*Decorations. I... just like them.*"
"*Do they hold any... meaning?*"
"*No. But I think they look like animals.
  This one's like a bird...*"
At least from where he stood, it looked like anything but a bird.
"*I've asked Stalina,
  and she said we're allotted up to 10 g of decorations per day.
  And I've scaled up the lightest ones.*"
"*Nice. And all I have is a pet.*"
"*You also can order some.*"
"*Speaking of which, got any paper?*"

Grip ran around the base to grab blank paper,
then the sheets he left at the canteen,
then to his old room for the pencil...
Thalia awaited him at the airlock.
The sun was almost down,
but he could now walk this patch of the desert even on a starless night,
with his eyes closed.

"Uh oh," Thalia let out as the inner door slid open,
 as she slowly lowered her reflector to the ground, eyes locked at the centre.
Two lizards waited for them there, one twice the size of the other one.
"Interesting..." Grip intoned.

They approached the centre with great care. Thalia assumed position across Newt,
Grip put the paper down and sat to the left, facing the larger lizard.
The first phase was already on the sand in front of them:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist-?] [sky-in] [be-new']"
"[true-not]" Grip wrote after a brief hesitation.
"[we] [see] | [exist] [sounds']"
 the large lizard wrote in silence, without rattling.
"[sound-?]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Newt wrote nothing and stayed behind.
It was unlikely he could even see the
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [sounds']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
over the large lizard's body.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist-not] [sky-in] [be-new']" Thalia assured towards the large lizard.
"[exist] [down-in] [living place']
|[living place] [go] [up']"
"[true]" Grip wrote, then elaborated:
"[exist] [up-in] [be-new-not']
|[be-new-not] [go] [down']"
"[yours-of-?]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"[true]" Grip pointed at the sign again.
"[I] [show]" Newt clicked, making the large lizard turn its eyes towards him.
Or at least Grip thought it was a "[show]".

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[you] [show] [aforementioned']
|[be-new] [show] [aforementioned']" it stated.
"[exist] [up-in] [be-new-not'] [exist] [down-in] [be-new']
|[be-new-not] [go] [down'] [exist] [down-in] [be-new-not']"
 Grip continued, and then decided to clarify:
 "[be-new] | [be-I-?]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
The lizard glanced at Newt again.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [here-in] [be-new']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Grip erased it all and attempted another tactic.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [up-in] [be-old'] [be-old] [go] [down']
|[exist] [down-in] [living place'] [living place] [go] [up']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
the lizard stated, without asking anything again.
"It's so that there--"
  Thalia began, but stopped,
  bombarded with a barrage of angry rattling.
Everybody looked at her, until she continued, nervously:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [up-in] [living place'] [be-first] [living place] [go] [down']"
"[exist] [down-in] [living place'] [be-second] [living place] [go] [up']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
The large lizard has inspected her writing, stopped to think,
then turned to offensive again:
"[exist] [living place-in] [yours-of] [be-new']"
"[true]" Grip agreed.
"[purpose-?]" it wrote with a swift swipe,
 the whisper of the parting sand echoing the absent rattling.
"[be-new] [see]
|[living place-in] [sleep-of]
|[exist-not] [danger']" Grip reassured it.
The lizard turned to Newt, rattled something:
"[you] [...-?] [...]"
Then went to write:
"[be-new] [be-danger-?] | [you-?] [sleep]"
"[be-new] [be-danger-not] | [I] [sleep]"
"[you] [...-?] [...]" it turned its head at Newt.
Grip squinted, as if it helped him understand.
"[exist] [inside-in] [I'] [...] [...] [...] [exist] [outside-in] [I']"
 was all he could make out of Newt's response.
The large lizard froze with its head turned.

Then, if rejoicing was laughter after all,
that's how the ensuing exchange played out:
"Hehe," the large lizard loudly chuckled.
"Hehe," Newt backed it with a nervous chuckle of his own.
"Hehe," the large one repeated before charging at Newt.
 "[I]! [...]! [you-...]! [...]! [...]!"
Instead of running away, Newt dashed towards Thalia.
As the large and less manoeuvrable lizard ran along the glass line
clicking at him, he took the shortest path to the glass half
and there he started climbing up Thalia's suit in a spiral
while rattling something back.
She, in turn, resisted the urge to shake him off,
gave Grip a short "WHAT" glance, twisted to keep an eye on Newt,
and started to carefully get up.
Grip sprang to his feet and, lost for words, clapped instead.
All rattling stopped for a second as he got everyone's attention.

Grip stretched his hand out towards Newt, he rattled something in return.
"[you] [be-...] ..." echoed the response from below.
Grip pointed at his palm with a finger,
Newt rattled again, but started climbing towards it.
Thalia twisted to take a better look at Newt, slightly hindering his efforts,
and asked Newt in a voice full of doubt:
"Go?"
"Stop," Grip nipped the idea in the bud. "Everybody calm down."
"[...-not]" the large lizard objected to something.

Newt reluctantly crawled onto Grip's hand,
letting Thalia untwist herself and act unencumbered.
Grip brought Newt closer to his ear to tune into his quieter ratting
until he could make out the repeated "[do-go]".
"No," Grip told him in his best language teaching tone,
and Newt lowered his head in silence.

Grip looked down; the context strongly implied
it was "[be-new] [do-go] [down']" being shouted at them.
"Explain."
"Explain what?" Thalia echoed, disoriented.
"Please just write 'explain', OK?"
Thalia sat down again to write "[do-explain]",
as ratting got quieter and calmer over time.

"[be-new] [be-proper-not] [do-go] [down']
|[I] [eat] [tail'] [be-new-of]" came the explanation.
"Hehe. Why not proper?"
"[do-explain] [be-new'] [be-proper-not]" Thalia continued.
The large lizard stopped to think for a good half a minute.
"[I] [see-not] [...] [...]" Newt rattled.
Grip gave the long-set sun a prolonged glance.

"[you] [show] [be-proper] [be-new']
|[you] [do-hold] [be-new'] [down']" it finally replied.
Grip started to lower himself back, while Newt rattled in panic:
"[do-hold] [up'] [do-hold] [up']"
 his clicking finally switched to simple concepts.
Grip unceremoniously grabbed him around the body and lowered onto the sand.
Newt wiggled, rattled "[do-hold] [up']",
tried to twist its way back into safety, then went for a running start.
Grip held him above the ground, watching the sand fly up,
while the large lizard calmly aimed for the Newt tail's... base.

"Uh-huh," Grip noted, and yanked Newt upwards at the last moment,
 much to the large lizard's angry, clicking dismay.
"I'll take him, you'll write," Thalia suggested without a trace of enthusiasm.
 Grip shook his head.
Newt stopped panicking and dangled obediently like an exhausted sausage.

"Is Newt proper? Will you bite his tail?" Grip dictated.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[be-new] [be-proper-?]
|[you] [eat-?] [tail'] [be-new-of]" Thalia gave up on alignment.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
The large lizard stopped rattling and replied with signs Grip never saw before,
so he could only assume what their meaning was:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[eat] [be-new'] [be-proper-not]
|[be-new] [break] [properness']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"Write down the last two."
She swiped the sand off the glass before writing the signs down.
The large lizard watched her, disoriented.
"Done."
"Why did he break it?"
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[do-explain] [be-new] [break] [properness']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Antestroke upon 'new',*" Grip corrected her.
"*Antewhat?*"
"*Forget it.*"
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[be-new] [want-not] | [yous] [know]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"Doesn't want what? Know what?"
The large lizard inferred his confusion without any translation,
and extended the writing:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[be-new] [want-not] [break'] [properness']
|[yous] [know] [yours] [know]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip brought Newt up to the eye level.
He wiggled approvingly, welcoming the upwards movement.
Grip placed him on his right shoulder.
Newt clung to it tight, its head bumping against Grip's chin.

Grip lowered to his knees, displacing Thalia from the centre.
"[I] [want] [show']" he wrote carefully. "[do-eat-not] [tail'] [be-new-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[be-new] [show-not] [be-new] [be-proper-not]
|[do-hold] [do-go] [be-new'] [down']"
"[I] [want] [know'] [explain']
|[do-explain] [be-new'] [break] [properness']"
"[be-new] [be-wise-not]
|[be-new] [want-not]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip just stared at the writing disapprovingly.
Thalia moved closer to Grip,
almost forming a shoulder-to-shoulder escape route for Newt.

"[be-new] [show-not] [we']
|[we] [go] [down']" the lizard ran out of patience.
"Good," Thalia suddenly said in her language teacher voice.
"[true-not]" Newt rattled into Grip's neck.
"We have a problem, Grip," she spoke softly. "We need to take a side."
Her voice had a soothing effect on Newt and irritated the other lizard.
"I need better answers than that," Grip spat out angrily.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[you] [think] | [we'] [be-danger-?]" he continued the questioning.
"[yours] [be-danger] | [yous] [be-danger-not]" was the reply.
"[be-new] [be-danger-?] [ours-of]"
"[be-new] [be-wise] [be-danger-not]
|[be-new] [be-wise-not] [be-danger]"
"[true]" Grip agreed wholeheartedly.

"[exist-not] [be-new']
|[exist] [be-new']" Grip wrote and topped the columns off with "[do-explain]".
"[exist] [be-new'] [animals-of]
|[exist-not] [be-new'] [ours-of]
Thalia stared daggers at Grip.

"[be-new-?] [show]"
 Grip wrote and added an isosceles right triangle as the third sign.
The lizard took its sweet time to answer:
"[aforementioned] [be-new-not]
|[aforementioned] [be-I-not]"
"[yours] [show-not] | [yours] [show]" Grip inquired. "[do-explain]"
"[ours] [see-not] [yours'] | [ours] [see] [yours']" the lizard parried.
"[yours] [want-?] [know'] [ours']..."
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Grip started writing and got promptly poked between the ribs. "Ow!"
"Are you trying to end the contact?" Thalia hissed furiously.
"It's just a question--"
"--You can't ask such loaded questions!--"
"--If it's only Newt who wants to talk to us, we're already done!"
 Grip hissed in return simultaneously.
 "If Newt only speaks for itself, that's already it!"

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
The large lizard, meanwhile, answered them:
"[we] [know-not] [purpose'] [yours-of]
|[exist] [interest'] [exist-not] [purpose']"
"[we] [show] [yous] [show] [exist] [purpose']
|[we] [show-not] [yous] [show-not] [exist-not] [purpose']" Grip steered back.
"[I] [understand-not] [purpose'] [yours-of]
|[be-new] [want] [purpose'] [yours-of]" it stated.
Grip glanced at his shoulder, reached out to the beginning of the phrase
and circled "[be-new] [want] [purpose']".
Newt didn't like the stretching manoeuvre, and started turning clumsily.
"[exist] [?#5?'] [ours-of] | [exist] [be-many-not] [ours']"

Newt's crawling was rewarded with grabbing him by the sides
and placing him back on the shoulder, facing outwards.
"[do-explain] | [?#5?']" | [?#5?] [be-animal-of-?]"
"[be-new] [want] | [you'] [help]"
"[I] [understand-not] [?#5?']"
"[?#5?] [be-first] | [?#5?] [be-second]"
 the lizard wrote sideways, as if it addressed someone invisible,
 and then returned to repeat to Grip:
"[exist] [be-many-not] [ours']"
"[exist] [be-many-not] [animals'-?]
|[aforementioned-?] [be-?#5?] [yours-of]"
"[exist] [be-many] [animals']
|[exist] [be-many-not] [ours']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

"May I?" Thalia reached towards the sand.
Grip nodded.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [ours-in] [object'] [be-complex]
|[aforementioned] [help] [exist'] [be-many-er]"
 she composed an unorthodox comparative.
<!-- align: [be-many] -->
"[I] [know] [aforementioned'] [exist'] [be-less-er']
|[be-new] [think] [aforementioned'] [exist'] [be-many-er']"
 the lizard borrowed part of it and instantly ruined her triumph:
"[ours] [want-not] | [yours'] [show]"
Thalia tensed up.
"[be-new] [want] [we'] [show]" Grip objected.
"[be-new] | [be-wise-not]" it countered.
"[object] [be-complex] [help] [exist'] [be-many-er'] - [true]
|[object] [be-complex] [help] [exist'] [be-less-er'] - [true]
|[object] [be-many] [help] [exist'] [be-less-er'] - [true]"
"[aforementioned-?] [help] [go']
|[you] [show] [aforementioned'-?]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"Yes, a teleport," Thalia hissed.
"[true]" Grip wrote.
"They're afraid of erasing..." Thalia voiced one rather obvious thought.
Newt began to shiver. Have its legs got tired?

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[do-exist-not] [be-less-er']
|[do-exist-not] [be-less-er']" the lizard stressed.
"[we] [help] [exist'] [be-many-er] [yous']" Grip assured and continued:
"[be-new] [want] [show'] | [you] [eat-?] [be-new']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
The lizard did not reply. Grip tried grabbing Newt again,
eliciting an unmistakable "[true-not]".

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[be-new] [go-?] | [living place'] [ours-of]" Grip asked.
"[be-new] [break] [properness']
|[be-new] [can] [go']" it replied and instantly followed with:
"[exist] [be-new'] [ours] [show]
|[exist-not] [be-new'] [ours] [show-not]"
"[ours] [can] [exist'] [be-many-er] [be-new']
|[yours] [can] [exist'] [be-less-er] [ours']" Grip composed.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"Wait," he addressed Newt, who tried to crawl across again.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[ours] [be-strong-not]
|[ours] [can-not]" the lizard objected.
"[yours] [can]" Grip circled, then proceeded:
"[exist] [animal-in] [be-old] [you']
|[exist] [outside-in] [animal-of] [you']
|[exist] [animal-in] [you-of] [you']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"[true]" the lizard agreed reluctantly and added
 "[yours] [know-not] | [yours] [know]"

"Uh-huh," Grip agreed.
Circled "[outside-in] [animal-of]".
Rubbed his eyes, tired of the darkness.
Elaborated further:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[substance] [yours-of] [be-danger]"
"[I] [understand-not] | [I] [be-substance-not]" the lizard objected.
"[yours] [be-danger]" Grip pressed forward. "[I] [know]"
"[do-explain]"
"[we] [go] [hold] [be-new'] | [we] [go]--"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

"He asked us not to tell adults," Thalia protested.
"It said Newt broke the properness. They'll kill him, he's no longer part--"
"--Hear me out! Yes, it said he doesn't speak for them.
 Yes, it promised to eat his tail.
 But they care, they-- they won't kill him," she argued.
"Why do they let me take him? If they care--"
"--Look, I hear you! I'm not convinced."

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[we] [go] [hold] [be-new'] | [we] [go] [living place'] [ours-of]"
 Grip continued.
 "[brain] [ours-of] [be-complex] | [you] [be-danger] [inside-in]"
"[can-not] [exist'-?] [inside-in] [ours']" the lizard wondered.
"[yours] [go] [inside'] | [can-not] [exist'] [I']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
The lizard started to run in circles, stopped to breathe, continued...
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] | [you']" it objected.
"[I] [be-new] [be-animal]" Grip explained to the best of his abilities.
"[be-new] [go] [inside']
|[exist] [be-less-er] [yours']" it double-checked.
"[exist] [be-less-er] [ours']
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
|[object]--" Grip didn't get the chance to finish the column.
The large lizard charged him, rattling loudly,
and started climbing the glass, then the right knee.
Grip clapped again, almost sending Newt flying off his shoulder,
and pointed at the sand with the index finger of his left hand.
His attacker slowly backed off to the sand half.

"*You dare climb me once more, and I'm the one taking a bite out of you, got it?
  It's--*"
  Grip almost got knocked off-balance by Thalia's heavy stare.
"[you] [be-danger-?] [I-of]" Grip asked menacingly.
"[true-not]" the lizard admitted.
"[be-new-of]" Grip replaced the last sign.
The lizard made a circle and came back:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [understand-not] [I] [understand]
|[you] [want] [eat'] [be-new']"
"*Come on!*" Grip uttered and went into explanations:
"[be-new] [want-not] [break'] [properness']
|[be-new] [want] [know'] [I']"
"[animal] [you-of]--
|[be-new] [break]--"
"[I] [go-not] [outside']
|[I] [be-one] [be-animal]" Grip interrupted.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
The lizard laid down to rest where it stood.
"*I can't take this any more, I need light,*"
  Thalia stood up and went for the reflector.
 "*And for the love of Maria: do not kill each other.*"
Newt felt that something's happening
and turned on the shoulders until he faced downwards.
"*You can climb down if that suits you better,*" Grip mumbled.

Thalia returned and set up illumination.
The large lizard stood up, walked back and forth and lay back down.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [can] [exist'] [be-many-er] [yous']" Grip wrote as he ran out of patience.
"[I] [want-not] | [be-new] [want]" it replied.
"Huh," Grip shifted closer, reinvigorated:
"[I] [do-go-?] [do-hold-?] [be-new] [be-new-?]
|[I] [do-go-?] [do-hold-?] [be-new] [two]"
"[true]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

"See?" he addressed Thalia triumphantly.
"Grip! You can't just take him--"
"--What? We just did that, remember--"
"--We can't just bring him--"
"--He's dead to them!... Don't you see? Where else will he go, they'll eat him!"
"No, they won't!"
"Why?"
"I... I don't believe it!"
"... wow," Grip threw up his left arm,
 remembering that Newt occupies the right shoulder at the very last moment.
"Newt has not agreed to that," Thalia countered.
"No," Grip succumbed to manic laughter.
 "Newt hasn't asked me anything either."
"You're gonna lose trust of both sides!" she hissed.
"Nah, they've just allowed it. It's gonna be fine,"
 Grip turned to the sand to write, cackling.
"Or become the worst decision in your life."
"Oh, right? And what's your..." Grip paused for a second. "What's your plan?"
Thalia didn't answer.
"Thought so."

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[you] [want-?] [know'] | [exist'] [be-many-er] [ours']" Grip asked.
"[object] | [be-complex]" the lizard replied without much interest.
Grip began to draw: "[be-old]", another "[be-old]", two arrows and a "[be-new]".
"[I] [understand] | [animals'] [be-new]"

Grip drew another diagram:
"[be-old] > [object] [be-complex] [know] > [be-old] [be-second]"
"[be-old-?] | [be-new-?]"
"[be-new] > [object] [be-complex] [know] > [be-new] [be-second]"
"[exist] | [two'-?]"
"[exist] | [be-many]"
Grip suddenly realized that the lizard ignores his finger,
staring up his arm at Newt instead.
But it didn't come to a fight, and the conversation resumed.
"[aforementioned] [help] [go']" the lizard was well-informed.
"[true]" Grip agreed.
"[aforementioned] [help] [go'] [sky']" the lizard extended.
"[aforementioned] [help] [go'] [sky'] [be-second]"
 Thalia crammed in another sign.
"[exist-not] [you'] [be-first]
|[you] [be-second] [go]" the lizard demonstrated its firm grasp of the concept.

"At least ask for their permission," Thalia said.
"[you] [want-?] [hold'] [be-new'] [two]" Grip asked.
"[hold] [be-new'] [be-wise-not] [one]
|[hold] [be-new'] [be-wise-not] [two]"
 the lizard replied and continued after a dramatic pause:
 "[properness] [be-broken] | [...] [...]",
 pointing with a tail at a blank space, inviting Grip to continue.
"[properness] [be-broken] | [yours] [be-many]"
 Grip wrote upside-down confidently.
"That's not an answer," Thalia complained.
"[I] [do-go-?] [do-hold-?] [be-new] [two]" Grip repeated the question.
"[you] [show] [you'] [can]
|[you] [want] [you'] [can]"
"Is that an answer?"
"Yes," she admitted reluctantly.

"[be-new] [go] [hold] [animal'] [be-large]..." Grip suggested.
"[be-new] [want-not] [animal'] [be-large]" the lizard objected.
"[be-new] [can-not-?]"
"[be-new] [want-not]"
"[be-large] [be-old-not]" Grip delineated.
"[be-new] [be-new-not]" the lizard brought them into a dead end.
"*What? Why? Where have you even seen large animals?*"
 Grip asked aloud, to no answer.

"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [here-in] [you'] [exist] [here-in-?] [you']"
 Grip reused the ritual form.
"[true]" the lizard didn't elaborate.
"[you] [hold] [sign'-?] [you-of]"
"[I] | [be-second]"
"[you] [be-second]
|[be-new] [...]" Grip pointed at a blank space.
"[be-new] | [be-new]"
 the lizard completed, contradicting its previous cryptic statement.
Grip slowly erased the writing.
"[you] [want] [know'-?]
|[exist'] [be-many-?] [ours']" the large lizard suggested.
"[true]"
"[two] | [nine]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"How much is it? When it's written like--" Thalia asked.
"[eleven-?]" Grip asked directly with an elaborate sign.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[true]"
"[yous] | [be-eleven-?]
"[true]" the Second waved away.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"There must be some mistake," Thalia murmured.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[be-new] [be-eleventh-?]"
"[ours] [be-new-not] | [ours] [be-old-not]"
"[do-explain]"
"[exist-not] [be-together] [ours']
|[exist] [be-together] [ours']"
"[object-?] [help] [exist'] [be-many-er] [yous']"
"[exist] [aforementioned']
|[exist-not] [aforementioned']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Oh, come on,*" Grip sighed.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [you'] [here-in] [exist] [you'] [here-in-?]"
"[true]" the lizard answered, and, this time, elaborated:
"[I] [show] [be-new'] [be-proper-not] [exist'] [be-less-er] [you']
|[I] [show] [you'] [want] [exist'] [be-new'] [be-many-er]"
"[I] [think] | [be-second'] [be-proper]" Grip tried to express gratitude.
"[be-proper] | [be-less-er]", the Second replied before running away.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

"*Come here, you critter. Hope you won't kill me today.*"
Grip picked up shaking Newt from the shoulder.
Newt couldn't decide which part of Grip to look at.
"*Please go guard the button.*"
"*What?.. Me?*"
"*Yes. I don't want him to run away.*"
"*Oh, that one...*"

Thalia dragged her feet to the airlock, into the darkness,
bitter and disappointed, then plopped onto the sand in front of it.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
Only then Grip has put Newt down to write:
"[you] [go] [living place'] [ours-of]"
Newt ran a circle, his legs almost failing him,
stumbled into Grip's hand and only then noticed the writing.
"[I] [want-not] | [go'] [down']" he replied.
"[exist] [I-in] [you']
|[exist] [be-less-er] [ours']" Grip kept grilling him.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Newt ran to the side.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [want-not] [aforementioned'] [I] [understand]
|[you] [want] [eat'] [tail'] [I-of]" he wrote,
slightly curving around Grip's hand.
"[I] [want] [exist'] [be-many-er] [you']" Grip sent him into another lap.
"[you] [see] [I'] [be-one]
|[you] [see-not] [I'] [inside-in]" Grip continued.
"[see-not] | [you']" Newt confirmed selectively.
"[you] [be-danger] [inside-in]"
"[I] [be-danger] [outside-in]"
Both stared at each other, confused.
"[exist] [inside-in] [animal] [yours-of] [you'] [be-danger-not]
|[exist] [inside-in] [I] [you'] [be-danger]" Grip clarified.
"[exist] [be-less-er] [you']
|[do-explain] [exist'] [you']"
"[object] | [be-complex]"
Newt rejoiced:
"[I] | [know]"
"[you] [want-?] [exist'] [be-many-er] [yours']" Grip inquired.
"[true] | [true]"
"[you] [go] [living place'] [ours-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Grip put his hand down and Newt climbed it.
He stood up to wave his left hand at Thalia.

"What's up?" she screamed from the distance.
"*We're coming home to copy this scarecrow,*" Grip giggled.
Newt was mesmerized by the sound of speech,
turning his head towards it.
"*Has he agreed to that?*"
"*Well, he's excited we can make more of them.
  Let's go, let's go hand him over to our biologists.*"
"*Maybe we even can.*"
"*Why not?*"
Thalia paused to read the remnants of the writings
before she picked up the light.
"*Anything else I need to know about?*"
"*I think it's all clear.*"
"*Glad it's clear for you,*" she remarked angrily.

"*What do you want to know?*"
 Grip briefly considered sticking Newt to his suit before following her.
"*What does it all mean to the human-lizard relationship,*" she replied.
"*That's the problem--*" Grip started giggling again.
"*Stop it! You act like a total kid! Think like a diplomat for once,*"
 she scolded him.
"*Listen, diplomat!... I was promised a life-sized statue!...
  with a lizard on my shoulder!...*" he struggled to contain laughter.
 "*While it should've been a brain slug all along!
   Not so cool now, is it? Not any more!*"
"*At least we'll see how it looks like,*" Thalia softened.
"*... on my gravestone!...*" Grip continued. "*A statue for my grave...
  OK, let's go. I hope he's sorry and everything.*"
"*If he's not, straight to the jar he goes. Wait, we'll need a second cage...
  And a...*" Thalia started giggling as well.
"*What?*"
"*I'll tell you later,*" she suppressed her laughter. "*Who's gonna carry him?*"
"*I will. He already saw my brain--*"
"*Outside or inside?... The suit!... You dolt, of course I didn't mean to...
  I can show you how--*"
"*--Ah, outside, of course!
  If he jumps down, he's getting his tail chewed anyway.*"
"*I still-- you know, forget it. Give him to me.*"

She held Newt until Grip got dressed, then placed him on his shoulder.
Together they paraded in silence
in front of a lizard openly watching them from a distance.

Past the airlock, Grip unzipped the hood and grabbed Newt with both his hands.
"*Right, bring us a beaker or something. And Maria.*"
Thalia rushed down the hallway in full outdoor suit,
slowing down as Stalina turned from around the corner
and transfixed her gaze on Grip... no, Newt:
"*Not this... thing again,*" she muttered as she began slowly approaching them.
"*Respect the ambassador!*" Grip caught a fit of manic laughter again.
 "*Thalia, apartments!*"
Thalia walked away briskly, as Lisa appeared, panicked and immediately left;
something Stalina ignored entirely while shortening the distance.
Not even blinking.
"Maria! Your time has come!" Thalia announced loudly from afar.
"Don't you dare--" echoed back at her.
"Dan, shut down the comms! Now!" Lisa's scream drowned away the rest.
 "Wait-- when?"
Stalina stopped uncomfortably close to them, her eyes on Newt
hanging off Grip's hands peacefully.
"*What's that?*" Grip wondered.
"*Lisa's lagging behind the plot.*"
"*No, what's 'comms'?*"
"*'Communications'. Except Derevyashko shut them down long ago.*"
"*When?*"
"*When we found out you ambassadors are killing each other.*"
Lisa entered the hallway again:
"Can I take a look?" she asked on approach,
intimidated by Stalina's stance and fixation.
"Sure," Grip didn't have a care in the world.
"That's... not how I imagined it."
"It? Your first contact?"
"Yeah..."

Maria and Thalia rushed towards them with a jar,
prompting Lisa to move out of the way.
"We also need sand," Grip greeted them.
"We'll move it into a large cage later," Maria dismissed him.
"The one he's already escaped once?" Stalina remarked.
"What do you want from me?!" Maria snapped.
"Sand!" Grip replied.
"Nothing we can't fix with a good old roll of duct tape," Thalia grinned.
"Poor guy can't talk! Can he get some sand, please?"
"Um, I can go out and bring some," Thalia suggested.
Maria held the jar next to Newt:
"Say again, how large is his tailwriting?" she asked mockingly.
"Ugh, forget it,"
Grip handed Newt to Thalia again, and she started cramming him into the jar,
letting Grip take off the suit at last...
"Totally unlike everything I've imagined," Lisa mumbled under her breath.

* * *

All abuzz, the crew poured into the canteen,
led by Grip carrying the jar.

"We have a guest, team!"
 he announced triumphantly as they took their seats.
 "Let me introduce Newt, our friend from out there,
  a reckless teenage lizard brain slug pilot!
  He doesn't speak English, well, maybe he knows some, but just a little.
  He has to stay with us until his small family calms down a little,
  as, currently, they have some... what's the word... disagreement..."

Grip finally noticed that the room isn't paying much attention to him.
Not even to Newt, for that matter.
Lisa asked Maria something and received a short bark of a reply back;
Dmytro Ivanovich exchanged glances with Stalina Filantievna guarding the door,
who nodded back...
"... Wait a second. Ahem. What's going on?"
"Don't you get it?" Derevyashko asked.
"Not a thing, and you know it," Thalia replied instead.
"What's going on?!" Grip raised his voice, interrupting all the commotion.
"You mean," Lisa didn't mince words much.
 "Aside from you bringing in an alien mind control weapon?"

"Newt! is not! a weapon!" Grip's voice sliced the silence with fervour.
 "... and he can't control us! I died, remember?"
"Suppress upfront, boom, done. If only every such--"
 Maria saw Grip's face drop and bit her tongue.
"Boom?... Done?!" he articulated word by word. "If only every what, Maria?..."
She kept her lips tight.

Crushed by the realization dawning upon him,
Grip slumped onto the couch between Thalia and Derevyashko.
Instead of leaning back, he bent forward,
until he almost engulfed the jar with his body
and zoned out for a good few seconds as the quiet chatter resumed.
