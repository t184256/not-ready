# (Not) disciplined

If the red one stuck to the facts meticulously,
the questions he got from the blue one got sillier and sillier:
"Grip Stavropolskiy.
 If Newt were a human, how would you describe his personality?"
"*I'm not doing this,*" Grip frowned.
 "*And I would advise everyone else against that.
   Newt is no human. None of that stuff of ours is applicable to him.*"
"In all fairness,
 you're actually rather consistent with this position of yours,"
 the blue one nodded.
 "But I'd still like to quote a few characterizations you've used--
  let me quote--"
"*No need to,*" Grip interrupted her anxiously. "*If I've used any, I was wrong.
  Newt is no human.*"
"OK, but you are. When you learned who killed you, did you feel resentment?
 Betrayal?"
"*No. I don't resent him, and he did not betray me.
  I understand--
  he just wanted to meet the parasite inside my head, don't you get it?
  He didn't know any different, that mind can be the animal itself.*"
"What did you feel when you've realized he was the one who killed you?"
"*Why does it matter? Dismay. Relief. Enough?*"
"Relief?"
"*I knew for sure: he didn't mean to.*"
"By the way, when exactly did you realize it was him?"
"*Precisely? When I saw the tracks... on the lizard cage.*"
"And when did you start suspecting him?"
"*Almost right away. As soon as I understood we brought him in.
  Like, who else? He was the only thing that changed.*"
"Could your relationship at the time be characterized
 as one based on mutual respect?"
"*I've said it before, I'll say it again:
  my attitude to Newt didn't change after the incident.
  And respect is a human emotion--*"
"Friendship?"
"*--stop labelling lizards with them.*"
"Trust?"
"*... that's a stretch. But, probably, yes,*" Grip agreed unexpectedly.
"And why aren't you arguing with that one?"
"*He trusted us enough to come over for a sleepover.
  We've been building up language, we didn't understand each other, and...
  I can't say he fully trusted us, but he trusted us in some things.
  I don't know how to apply these concepts to our relationships...
  I... time and time again I saw Newt risk his safety to understand us better.
  I think that could be called trust?*"
"You know best.
 And what about the dynamics, did he trust you more each passing day?"
"*I'd like to believe that. That was my task. I did my best.*"
"Have you started to trust him more?"
"*It's complicated. I understood that I don't understand a thing,*"
 Grip took a long pause.
 "*I understood him a bit more.
   I don't know, how does the 'trust' label apply to all of that.*"
"If only I understood which words do you deem acceptable.
 Could you try to describe your relationships again, maybe that'd help?
 Who were you, to each other?"
"*... We were like a scoutmaster to each other, but in turns,
  constantly changing roles. And never fully understanding each other.
  I think, it might always be like this, with all the lizards.
  We're too different from them.*"
"OK, and the other lizards?"
"*We didn't talk much with the other lizards. We mostly discussed Newt.*"
"And is it OK to compare Newt with the other lizards?"
"*Sure, I can try. Newt is more curious. Smaller in size.
  Braver. He trusted us more, again.*"
"And what was the other lizards' attitude to that?"
"*I don't know, disapproval?... You're digging into lizard emotions again.
  I can't even say that. Ask some scientists whether lizards have emotions.*"

"Helga Voronov.
 Have you suspected so-called Newt of involvement in Grip's murder?"
"Yes, I have."
"Since when exactly?"
"Right away."
"And when did you become sure of that?"
"Same time as Grip."
"Have you shared your suspicions with Grip?"
"No, I haven't."

The blue one stepped back, to the lowest row of seats,
and quickly checked her phone.

"*Helga Voronov,*"
 the red one strode along the table to immediately substitute her.
 "*Why have you kept your suspicions a secret from your partner?*"
"Murder is one serious accusation,"
 Thalia spoke painstakingly slowly.
 "And Newt is their envoy.
  I'd never toss around baseless allegations like that."

Ah, no, turns out silly questions were contagious.
"*Grip Stavropolskiy. Describe your relationships with Helga Voronov.*"
"*... are you interested in anything specific?*"
"*Well, are you fine with labelling at least this relationship as friendship?*"
 the red one was openly amused.
"*Yeah, maybe, this one's fine,*" Grip smiled back.
"*Awesome. When you talked to the lizards,
  would it be fair to say she steered the conversation? Set the subject?
  Led the talks?*"
"*I'd like to think we were on equal footing,*"
 Grip shook his head.
 "*We've had our ups and downs and arguments,
   I'm kinda better with writing, she --- with diplomacy...
   Maybe I underestimate her manipulation skills, but I think it was equal,
   me and her. And she definitely wasn't in charge.
   I don't even know her job title, but it wasn't my superior.*"

"*Dmytro Derevyashko,*" the red one picked a new victim.
 "*As Grip's immediate superior, please clarify the following:
   does bringing an alien to the base
   constitute a violation of Grip's work duties?*"
"*No, as far as my judgement goes, it does not,*" he droned back.
Grip raised his hand.
"*That's not how we roll here,*" the blue one shook his head at him.
Grip lowered his hand back.

"*Stalina Ivanova.
  You had RPB trigger twice in a row before Grip's death,
  but each time you just recalibrated. Why?*"
"*As you're perfectly aware from the vitals logs you have at your disposal,
  I expected a new animal to appear at the base.*"
"*Yes, but didn't you find it odd that the next day--*"
"*Now, this kind of questions, I'm not answering those,*"
 she replied, unfazed. "*Especially through the lens of my speculations.*"
"*Stalina Ivanova,*" the red one repeated coldly.
 "*Has RPB triggered once again in a day or so?*"
"*I'm sorry, I don't have to answer your questions.*"
"*Daniel Washington,*" the red one kept staring at Stalina.
 "*Has Stalina Ivanova ever taken any measures
   to keep the vital parameters monitoring secret
   from either the crew or the centre?*"
"I have absolutely no idea what kind of measures could that possibly be.
 Lee and me aside, she immediately reported
 both the event and her suspicions to Dmytro as well,
 and that's about everyone above suspicion."
"*And was it him who demanded you turn off the comms?*"
"With the looming interspecies conflict on the horizon,
 yeah, that was a smart move."

"*I'd like to remind all of you this was the first,
  temporary communications outage,*"
 the red one stepped aside from Stalina.
 "*Daniel Washington.
   What exact measures are there behind the so-called 'closing the planet'
   I keep hearing about?*"
"I'm glad you asked," Dan sat upright as she approached him.
 "It ain't what springs to mind, it's much simpler, really.
  Almost all transmissions, batched and unbatched, all the queues,
  they normally need the communications officer's approval anyway.
  If one approves nothing,
  and shuts a few automated systems down,
  that's already it."
"*'It' meaning radio silence?*"
"That's not an appropriate term,
 radio's only used within the planet anyway.
 But yes, all this pompous 'closing planets' stuff
 is just glorified keeping it mum.
 And that gives you a one-way membrane
 to contain the sensitive information."
"*Specifically?*"
"Lizard scans. That-thing-inside-the-lizard scans."
"*Why would that need a one-way radio silence,
  if you could just agree to not transmit it?*"
"... That wasn't my decision to begin with," Dan began, cautiously.
 "I got a feeling they had a bit of a distrust down there when it comes to
  publicizing... the internal details... of the real inhabitants."

The blue one rushed towards the table, but the red one was quicker:
"*Maria Stinner. Couldn't you clarify the nature of such distrust--*"
Grip rolled up his eyes.
"*--and the way the scans could take to leave the planet
  without your active involvement.*"
"After I would've figured out the way to prepare them for scanning,"
 Maria picked words with great care,
 "anyone with access to the teleports
  could send them to the rest of the humanity."
"*We've just established
  that this requires coordination with the communications officer.
  Your communications officer. Why take such measures then?*"
"... I'm not the best person to answer that...
 At the very least, I was under the impression,
 that the data could be masqueraded as something else entirely
 and exfiltrated that way...
 by misleading the communication officer."
"*Daniel Washington--*"
"*Folks, it's way simpler than that.
  I never see what exactly goes to Federation anyway.*"
"*Maria Stinner.
  You left the question about the nature of the emerged distrust unanswered.*"
"I..." Maria began very carefully.
 "I-- even though I never stated that --I could've left an impression with Grip
  that... introducing Epsilon Indi 3 inhabitants to people could
  strip them of free will."
"*Can it?*"
"I can't know for sure.
 We had just one case, I could not adequately observe that,
 and I lack sufficient evidence for claiming Grip lost his free will anyway."

"Really? Grip Stavropolskiy," the blue one displaced the red one.
 "Has Maria left you with such and impression."
"*She's contributed,*" Grip snorted, "*to creating one*".
"Who else has contributed to that?"
"*Actually, the lizard? One I've talked with? One that moved its tail,
  wrote sentient thoughts with it and had no free will?*"
  Grip proudly replied.
The displaced red one has awkwardly raised her fist to conceal her chuckle.
The blue one has not expected such a reply.

"*So, you're saying,*", the red one added fuel to the fire,
 "*That Maria and the lizards left you under an impression,
   that this technology is unsafe to trust the Fist with?*"
"*No,*" Grip smiled.
 "*Maria and lizards... left me an impression...
   that this technology is unsafe to entrust to people.
   Because people could use it to harm other people.*"
"So, you don't trust Federation?" the blue one asked casually.
"I don't trust people," Grip replied. "In general.
 If we've got prisons, that means people can harm each other.
 And we have militia. And Fists have police,
 so they also have people that can harm each other.
 Also, on the meat level, for the lizards, we and fists are all the same."
"You're right.
 Police protects people from exactly that:
 crimes committed by other individuals.
 Not from wars though. And not from new biological weapons.
 To protect yourself from a state, one needs another state.
 Don't you trust your own state, Grip?"
"*I don't know what it is,*" Grip smiled.
 "*We haven't studied that at school yet.
   Tell me what a state is, without people,
   and I'll try to answer whether I trust that or not.*"
"That's not how things are done here," the blue one recovered from his rebuke.
 "But, out of respect for your tender age,
  I'll try to explain that one.
  A person could fly into a temper, for example,
  do something wrong and regret that later.
  A state is such a balanced system
  that it's much more stable than a human,
  so one could trust it more than the individuals comprising it."
"*But the system is still made of people,*" Grip shrugged.
 "*You-- As you say, but I can't answer your question.*"
"*Grip Stavropolskiy,*" the red one changed the subject.
 "*Do I understand correctly, that you've decided lizards could be weaponized?*"
"*Yes.*"
"*Why?*"
"*I died from one, meaning they sure could.*"
"*I'm sorry, but doesn't humanity wield much more efficient poisons, bombs,
  bullets--*"
"*And knows what to do with all of that. But not with lizards,
  so, no one would be worse if we first thought it through in depth.*"

"*Dmytro Derevyashko,*" the red one began again.
 "*As Grip's immediate superior, please comment on the following:
   would Grip's refusal to hand over the technology to the Federation
   constitute a violation of Grip's work duties?*"
Dmytro Ivanovich cleared his throat:
"*Look, I'm going to save you some time
  and quote both the instructions issued to him.
  First, the primary one:
  establish and maintain diplomatic relationships between humans and lizards,
  which I've later put together as "befriend them", for brevity’s sake.
  Second, the secondary one, went like this:
  when you convince lizards to hop over,
  try to make sure they pick Federation. It didn't come to that one.*"
"*And do you think closing the planet violates these instructions?*"
"*At the very least, that's up for interpretation,*"
 he pretended to lapse into deep thinking.
 "*He established the relationships alright,
   has a track record of securing more meetings.
   As I understand it, earned their trust and
   is saving them from a demographic catastrophe, possibly, this very moment.
   As to the limited connectivity with the planet,
   I thought that won't last forever.*"
"*Would you also deny this exceeds his authority?*"
"*Now, that's one curious question I'd love to come back to,
  were the investigation to establish it was Grip who did that,*"
 his demonstratively chill intonation was ruined by the mockery creeping in.
 "*And for now I'd just rather highlight that when Daniel told us the story of
   him, Stalina and my copy shutting the communications down,
   that somehow hasn't elicited a single question
   about the authority of either of them.*"

"Grip Stavropolskiy," the blue one took the initiative.
 "Back then, on Epsilon Indi 3, were you aware that
  instigating a suicide pact, assisting suicide or driving one to suicide
  are considered felonies, according to both Federation and Fist laws?"
"*No,*" Grip raised his palm, and removed the earphone with the other hand.
 "Could you, please, repeat the last sentence, word-by-word?"
"Back then, on Epsilon Indi 3, were you aware that
 instigating a suicide pact, assisting suicide and driving one to suicide
 are felonies, according to both Federation and Fist laws?" she repeated slower.
"*No,*" Grip placed the earphone back in. "*Definitely not.*"
"Now that you are, can you guess why?"
"*I guess, because it's assumed we...
  haven't asked the opinion of those who stayed?
  Why, does it matter if it's a copy and that's it, the copy,
  who made the decision?*"
"None whatsoever. The legislation is rather conservative in this respect."
 the blue one shook her head.
 "And what do you think about it?"
"*That's a choice. I would agree,*" Grip treaded carefully.
 "*Now, whether that could be done to others,
   that's something to ask the others about.*"

For the first time in the entire session, the twins looked at each other, and,
seemingly, ignored everything Grip said.
For a few more seconds they've contemplated their next move.

"Grip Stavropolskiy," the blue one continued.
 "Do you claim that humanity poses a threat to the lizards' way of life?"
"*Yes,*" Grip agreed readily.
"How so?"
"*As we've investigated the incident, we've learned, that--*"
Grip stuttered.
Something on the table glared into his eye-- a tiny grey spider.
Right in front of him, on a black tablet, behind the pencil.
The spider didn't like the attention and commenced a retreat.
"What's that?!" Grip stretched out his arm.
With a loud rumble, Stalina lunged forward to catch it -- and missed.
Maria jumped up and stood behind the chair.
Grip stretched across the table for the last ditch attempt to catch the spider.
And also missed.

"*I'm sorry,*" Grip slid back with both of his hands raised.
"I saw something," Maria sat back.
"What exactly did you consider to be a threat to the lizards' way of life?"
 the blue one continued calmly.
"*We've learned there's just eleven of them,*" Grip proceeded.
 "*When it's just eleven of you, and we're sixty billion,
   that's a huge difference.*"
"And you want to make more of them?"
"*Exactly. We stayed back to make more of them,
  and I really think that if we help them with that,
  they will all begin to trust us,
  and it'll be safer for them,
  and they'll want to continue this contact,
  because we've helped them.*"
"But why would that require closing the planet for decades?"
"*I don't know how much would it take.
  First we need to learn a safe way to do it,
  then we need to actually do it...*"
"But shouldn't you do the opposite: in order to do it safely,
 invite as many experts as possible?"
"*Maria is a qualified specialist. Too many cooks spoil the broth--*"
Maria couldn't sit straight and wanted to say something,
but nobody asked her.
"*--and it'll all take a lot of time,
  and they're afraid of our mechanisms--
  they lead very simple lives, and they're bothered by complex things
  --and they'll have to get used to the new people,
  so it's best if it's me, Thalia and Maria, starting with Newt,
  and then we'll see.*"

"*We'll see,*" the red one shook her head and extended her arm, pointing at Dan.
 "*What are your views on the incident, closing the planet,
   allegations and the other topics we've covered?
   Daniel Washington.*"
"*Me?*" Dan wondered.
 "*What about me, there ain't a single decision I've made,
   and, as far as my views go, I'd rather keep'em to myself.*"
The red one wasn't satisfied with that, but Dan stayed silent.
"*Irakli Shpreigl*", she moved her hand at last.
"*Not a single question before, and now that,*" he grunted.
 "*I won't keep mine to myself. I've been around, saw it all,
   and now I trust neither people nor governments.
   I find the very idea of 'introducing' sentient into sentient
   outright heinous.
   As far as I'm concerned, they did the right thing.*"
"*Lisa Frei.*"
"I also don't have a... well-formed opinion. Fine by me."
"*Maria Stinner.*"
"I don't think we were in position to make such decisions...
 And the conclusions that... some of us drew
 were hasty, rushed and deeply emotional.
 I'm against the closing."
Grip was sitting sideways, stared at her sceptically,
and now he had to turn straight quickly.
"*Grip Stavropolskiy.*"
"*I consider the incident to be a mutual misunderstanding,
  closing the planet to be... the best option out of all the available ones,*"
 Grip was getting anxious.
 "*I agree with Maria that we're not the ideal people to decide.
   We were, more like, scientists.
   But I don't consider myself guilty.*"
"*Stalina Ivanova.*"
"*I decry your attempts to incriminate organizing or instigating suicide
  as absurd.
  Exceeding authority: not my decision to make.
  The incident, I consider it to be exactly that: an incident.
  And I've always disapproved closing the planet.*"
"*Could you clarify?*"
"*Call that intuition,*" she smirked.
"*Dmytro Derevyashko.*"
"*I consider the actions of my subordinate justified, adjusted for his age.
  For the life of me, I don't see which instructions he has violated;
  and exceeding authority, I've already made my point on that.
  Whatever charges you might press, I'd find that excessive.*"
"*Helga Voronov.*"
"*I'll refrain from commenting.*"

The blue one couldn't take it any more and stepped up again:
"Grip Stavropolskiy.
 I just can't get my head around one thing.
 It poses little importance for the charges, if we were to press any,
 but it's paramount for the public opinion,
 so I can even close the session for this answer.
 Session's over."
Behind her, the red one stared at the back of her head,
foreshadowing a tough conversation between the two of them.
"Whom were you saving, Grip? Us or them?"
At this point both Stalina and Maria shook their head vigorously,
suggesting Grip to refrain from answering, but he didn't see them.
Not only because of the stupid table ---
he just so happened to lean forward to place the earphone back.
"Us from them, and them from us."
"Oh well, that's what I thought. Thank you all--"
Without the earphone,
the rest of her phrase drowned in the rumble from all the massive chairs.

"*What was that? The thing that ran away?*" Stalina leaned towards Grip.
"*I don't know, some badge-spider.
  I thought it was part of the pen, but it runs.*"
"*How did you notice it?*"
"*It lit up, right into my eye! We should ask Thalia.*"

Grip looked around. They were let out through another door,
and Thalia was way ahead.
Dan put his phone back, locked eyes with him and stated in a quiet voice:
"I think I know why they let us go so quickly. Let's go--"
Grip nodded and followed Stalina, but got caught and dragged away by Thalia
right behind the door:

"*Grip, Lora. Lora is stupid!*" Thalia was boiling up.
"Hey!" Lora, a tall high schooler, took offence to that.
 "That word I do know."
"--and I'm 'valenok'--"
"Nice to me--"
"Lora thinks we should've been housed them in our heads!"
"She what?" Grip squinted.
"--that's not exactly what I--"
"--tell her!"
"Why?" Grip asked directly.
"First of all, you haven't even tried to--"
"What do you mean 'we haven't tried', we have.
 Have you read the whole fairy tale? It didn't work great."
"Yeah-yeah, you died. But you had a cure, and you didn't even try!"
"Try what, putting them into our heads?"
"What if this is the key to understanding them?
 The right way for humans and lizards to coexist?
 As a whole? What if nobody should've learned any languages?"
Thalia threw her hands at Lora in desperation, as in, don't you see,
she's clearly off the rails!
"Why? What for?" Grip insisted.
 "Do you want to always have another sentient being with you?"
"Well, maybe I do. And now, thanks to someone, I won't even--"
"Marry."
"What?"
"Find some guy and marry him."
Thalia propped herself against Grip's shoulder to laugh out loud.
"This is totally different," Lora answered amicably.
 "A guy is a separate creature--"
"And so are they!"
"Yes!" Thalia echoed him.
"--and here we'd be together inside one head--"
"Would you lock him up there?
 Why do you even think there will be a 'you' in there?"
"Yeah!-- Wait, what?" Thalia turned her head at Grip.
"Why do we think lizards survive that?"
"What do you mean? They don't survive?" Thalia blinked at him.
"Perhaps they don't survive," Lora shrugged.
 "Perhaps they do. Who knows?
  Right, nobody does. What you should've done is to see for yourself!"
"Maybe we will, we just won't--"
 Grip stated, distracted by the commotion in the middle of the hallway.
 "Wait a minute."

Dan towered the crowd, the rest orbited him.
Stalina Filantievna was already escaping his gravitational pull.
"--what does that mean?--"
"*--from up there--*"
"--what are they saving up for--"
"--twenty-two--"

"*Super-spy! Fetch the information!*" Grip stroke a pose, pointing at Dan.
Thalia reached the crowd in three large hops, sliced through with another one
and hung onto Dan's hand, to great dismay of everyone around.
A copy was sent to everyone and the commotion fragmented into smaller clusters.
Grip joined Thalia, next to Derevyashko.

> +22, they all argue. T.
> Can't fix reproduction alone without travel. Can read and alter memory. M.
> Right decision. We aren't ready. 20 years. G.
> Hi. N1.

"*What, what does it all--*" Grip wondered.
"*Plus twenty-two means we did it! Yee-haw!*"
"*And 'T' means you!*"
"*Then 'M' is Maria! 'G' is--*"
"*And 'N one' means Newt! The original one.*"
"*O-o-oh.*"
"*What does it mean 'can't fix reproduction'? What 'travel'?*"
"*We need to ask Maria. About memory as well,*" Thalia scanned the hallway.
 "*Oh, Irakli Kosmovich, they don't have a 'hi', do they?*"
"*They sure don't,*" the linguist confirmed.
 "*Somebody taught them ours. Who could it be?*"

"*Grip, don't you find something odd?*" Dmytro Ivanovich asked.
"'Can't fix'? 'Alone without travel'?"
"*No. Do you find something missing?*"
"*... What? Everything here is excessive.*"
"*I would've said 'goodbye'.*"
"*I wouldn't. I wouldn't write anything.*"
"*Wait,*" Irakli Kosmovich laughed. "*I wouldn't write 'goodbye' either.*"
"*Why?*" Derevyashko wondered.
"*Good luck charging--*"
"*--us with suicide, right!*" Grip finished the sentence. "*Yeah!*"
'*Right!*" Irakli Kosmovich gleefully confirmed.
"*Why then?*" Grip turned to Dmytro Ivanovich.
"*To be sure they're gone.*"
"*Who cares? Would he come back? And we'll get mixed up?*"
"*No,*" Derevyashko let out a faint smile. "*No way.*"
"*Would claim my life? Inheritance?*"
"*No, that's not--*"
"*That's it, then.*"

Grip waved to Martin Aleksandrovich,
watching this from far away with Stalina and Lisa.
Who is this man? Grip never saw him before.
Thalia was next to Maria:
"--still out there? What do you think?" Maria asked.
"I don't think so."
"I do. And you, Grip?"
"I think it does not matter."
"Hey, not cool!" Thalia protested. "You were supposed to be the third--"
"*I, uh, wanted to ask.* About the press.
 What was that thing that ran away from us?
 About this small, like a spider, grey, we saw it, and it ran--"
"Well, you answered it yourself," Thalia looked at him, quizzed.
 "They wanted an exclusive video. Was that the ruckus--"
"Yeah. Didn't catch it. They'll have funny video now..."
"Nah, that's not what they're after, they want you speaking.
 Especially something they could twist.
 Whatever. If you see yourself talking, from below your chin,
 that's where it came from."
Thalia finished the sentence,
staring intensely at a white-haired old man who greeted them downstairs.
As he approached them, he pulled his hands out of the pockets.
He then bumped Thalia and Grip's shoulders with his fists and opened his palms,
revealing two badges, each depicting a curly-haired bearded head.
"Glad to meet you two!
 I'm honoured to appoint you honorary members of the Newest Ethics Academy."
"Thank you," Thalia squeaked, grabbed the badge and ran away.
"New Aesthetics?" Grip asked.
"*Newest Ethics,*" the old man switched to passable Russian.
Grip raised the weightless, printed badge,
letting his imagination try it on to the statues he saw earlier today.
It didn't really fit in stylistically.
"*Would like to know what it is?*"
"*Yeah,*" Grip nodded.
"*Enroll and you could learn it all.
  Perhaps there still will be problems left for you.*"
"*Problems?*"
"*Those you brought. About lizards. Memory. Mind control.
  Do you say this:
  'if this somehow true could be, mushrooms would've grown on ye?'*"
"*Yeah, we do,*" Grip liked his weird pronunciation.
"*So for centuries, for centuries we're debating various hypotheticals,
  thought we know.
  And now you come with those lizards of yours: see, here they are, mushrooms.
  Mind control. Memory. Lizards'. Ours.
  What did you have, philosophers? Remind us? And we just...?*"
"*We didn't grow them, just discovered them,*" Grip nodded gleefully.
 "*But I understand what you're saying.*"
"*Yeah. So we'll think again now, probably, anew.*"
"*And this 'honorary member' thing, it's...?*"
"*You have the right to attend our meetings...
  But, I'm afraid, you live so far away, this will be mostly a formality.*"
"*Pity.*"
"*Pity. But big thank you! And this is for you, to remember...*"

He made a few steps away, issued a prolonged glance to Thalia,
who was all but shrieking at Lora:
"--your idea, it's even neat! It's you whom I hate! How could you--"
"Dear guests!" he interrupted their one-sided scene.
 "I'm afraid we can't let you go just yet,
  but we could offer refreshments in the meantime. Follow me down--"
"*Listen, now when we'll be tried and--*" Grip addressed Thalia.
"*They pretty much let you walk away with that,*" she cut him short,
 staring at Lora, who was being distracted by Lisa.
"*Are you sure? One hundred percent?*"
"*Not a hundred, but stop worrying about it, worry about the media.*"

* * *

This micro-canteen's food stand was almost non-existent and barren.
Instead, pizza boxes were stacked on one of the tables.
Derevyashko and Martin Aleksandrovich grabbed one each
without breaking their stride and headed for the furthest table.
An impromptu council of Thalia, Lora and the white-haired man
was debating something so intensely,
Grip couldn't follow it any more after all he's been through today.
Maria and Lisa kept tabs on them,
and Dan kept asking Grip questions:
"How was it like, talking with lizards?"
"Totally unlike people. You can't translate them.
 We have no words for them, they -- for us."
"They don't have many, but they do have some, don't they?
 'Go', 'stop', 'look', 'yes', 'no'--"
"No, no 'stop', and, most importantly, no 'good' and 'bad'.
 Like, they have it, but it's something different.
 We thought about it so much..."
"So, did you understand it?"
"We did. That they have no such words.
 And when they do, you can always understand in many ways."
"And emotions--"
"I'm not joking. I don't know. If Newt is afraid or...
 what's the word when you're deciding to do or not do..."
"Hesitation?"
"Maybe."
"So, do they have words for emotions?
 If they have a word for hesitation, they probably feel it."
"No. They have 'rejoice', but it's..." Grip waved his hands.
 "Action, word for action, not emotion."
"Are you really not upset with Newt?"
"Oh come on!" Grip shook his hands in the air.
 "How many times do I have to repeat? Why does nobody listen to me?"
"I don't know!" Dan bent even lower.
 "I really thought you're just being noble, forgiving him and everything.
  How can you not be upset?"
"Like this. Why should I be upset? I wasn't even there, maybe that's why?
 When I was little, my mom made those," Grip played out a little pantomime.
"Bubbles?" Dan mustered a guess.
"Yeah, and I smashed all of them. Am I now a terrible bubble killer?
 No, I was just curious. And he was just curious."
"What, he didn't want to take control over our leader and conquer the world?"
 Dan mocked disappointment.
"He'd better not fall and smash himself. I'll be back."

Grip was absent for just a little,
and Thalia and Lora already had a peace-making ceremony.
Even though they didn't really agree at all.
Under the old man's influence, Lora admitted,
that they were right to close the planet, but purely by accident,
as they haven't learned about altering memory yet.
Meaning, she didn't abandon her head cohabitation ideas.

Now Thalia was catching up with some shared news with Lora,
and Lisa seemed to set a goal to open each and every pizza box.
Grip decided to go to the Russian-speaking corner,
but first to grab a piece of pizza.
"You should try this one, and this one as well.
 If it's such a breakthrough and stuff,
 why isn't every single headline about writing memory?"
 Lisa asked Maria.
"Because the sane ones understand it's not about people,
 and all the nutjobs already think we can decode and implant thoughts?"
 Maria waived her slice of pizza.
"Are you sure we don't?"
Maria stared at Lisa in silence until she stopped her rummage and looked back.
"What in the world you're inhabiting
 led you to believe we already can?"
"I wouldn't go to school then!--" Grip remarked.
"Precisely."
"--just learned everything on my way home, boom! No schools!"
"No courts," Maria nodded.
"No jails?" Grip suggested.
"No reports."
"Oh yeah," Lisa responded.
"Is it really a bad thing?"
"A wonderful one. No complaints either," Dan replied.
 "Why are you so bitter, Mary? Looks like they let you go. Is something--"
"Of course I'm furious," she pursed her lips.
"With whom?"
"With myself!"
"Because of what she wrote?"
"What she didn't. The thoughts bit could come in handy--
 but not a word on reproduction. What an asshole."
"Why do you call yourself this," Grip was saddened.
 "You should love yourself. She loves you too, so she cares about you--"
Maria wasn't buying this.
"--so it means you shouldn't know."
"So it means she knows how angry I am at her! She could've...
 Now I'll never know how... are they seeds or have they--"

At the table Grip hasn't reached yet,
Martin Aleksandrovich has let out a loud whistle.
"*Come on,*" Derevyashko looked over at his phone. "*Just a bunch of idiots.*"
"*What's up?*
"*An armed robbery.*"
"What's happening?"
"Some thugs at bay--"
Heavy steps marked Marek's arrival,
an apologetic old man towered behind him.
"Go, go, go, now! Feds, in the front, fists, right behind them!"
Grip stopped to put the cup back and to watch
how the cool (counter?)intelligence officers pick pizza:
they grab boxes from almost the very bottom of the stack.
Martin took one, Derevyashko took two.
Makes sense, these should be the ones with the most pizza left inside.

Turns out, local gravity turned Irakli Kosmovich into a good runner.
As they were approaching the exit, the intelligence officers
covered themselves from the rain with pizza boxes,
while Marek produced a phone that discussed the news loudly:
"--for a long time. Andy, could you recall such a daring raid?"
"No, time to call my grandma.
 A raid, what a word, a raid, that's something from her era indeed.
 The police has already--"
The sound from the phone has yielded to the screams of the crowd,
awaiting them despite the rain.
It was already dark, and one couldn't make out people,
save for the yellow police officers along their way.
The black limousines were washed by a sea of glowing signs,
the writings on them didn't matter anyway.
Grip wouldn't mind those limousines to be taller and longer.
"Tha-li-a! Tha-li-a!" the crowd began to chant.
"*Daddy, daddy, why rob somebody on Amster?*"
 Thalia zipped through this chaos like a fish in the water.
"*Good question!*" Martin Aleksandrovich ran out of breath.
 "*What do you think?*"
"*What's the problem?*" Grip tried to catch up with them.
"Bye, colleagues!" Dan screamed behind them.
Grip turned around: Dan folded himself twice over to fit into the limousine,
Lisa jumped into the other one.
"*Say, I robbed you and took your--*" Thalia moved closer to Grip.
"*--yeah, yeah?--*",
 the young fed unencumbered with worldly possessions mocked her,
 as he sped up before the gate.
"*You're a bad example! Just pants and--*"
 Thalia gave up and sprinted on, skipping over three steps at once
 to catch up with her dad.
 "*I know! They didn't just snatch some secret, they wanted to humiliate them!*"
"*Attagirl! Could be,*"
 Martin Aleksandrovich donned a wide smile,
 as he followed Marek deeper into the hall and turned to catch his daughter
 with his free hand.
 "*Espionage and reputational damage.
   Smells like I've got a kistin one in here,*"
 he lowered the box, but Thalia wasn't interested in pizza.
"*And I've got a--*" Derevyashko opened one of his boxes.
"*Wait, are we on the run? Was it the robbery--*"
 Grip pointed at his boxes.
"*Oh yeah, totally us,*" Martin played along.
 "*Can't even cross a street without robbing someone.*"
"*Martin, what--*"
"*Yeah?*" he turned towards the voice.
"*--in the world are you doing in here?*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich mocked him.
"*Where?*"
"*In the embassy!*"
"*I don't know... Everybody ran, and so did I,*"
 he replied with an innocent face.
 "*Guess I gotta go then? Is the subway pass still there?*"
"*Let's go, you absolute..."* Marek replied through his hand glued to his face.

They haven't yet settled in the hall,
as the entire space to the left of the door turned into a giant screen.
"*Officers!*" a grim face that could rival Svobodin's portraits in monumentality
 barked all over the room.
Wait, not a grim, rather-- no--
"*Stay in good health, comrade General!*"
 Aksat and Dmytro snapped into attention.
Grip stood where he was, disoriented.
And the face: white-haired, angular, general's face was not alive,
it flowed in between emotions, never fully settling for one.
"*At ease, at ease you are after closing planets! I'm already--*"
"*Hi, pops!*"
"*--informed on your shenanigans, so listen closely. Kirenko--
 Who's that?!*" his unnatural eyes popped out.
 "*Send her off, right now!*"
Thalia took offence at that, and slowly walked out into the hallway.
The face has goofily turned its eyes towards the very wall it was displayed on.
Grip considered retreating to Irakli Kosmovich's corner, but decided against it.
"*Special comms, son of a gun... So, Kirenko got there first,
  now you owe him a big one. Derevyashko, you stay. Plan 'shadow'.*"
"*Aye plan 'shadow'!*" Derevyashko's face skewed from the bad news.
"*... ... Right. Down with your unhinged antics.*"
"*Beggars can't be choosers,*" Aksat said in a soothing voice.
"*You stirred that up, you calm it down,*"
 Thalia's pops continued in the meantime.
 "*Tomorrow, eighth, at six, on the carpet, public flogging,
   then we'll think what to do with that kindergarten of yours.*"
"*Aye eighth at six!*"
"*You're free to go.*"
"*I have the honour!*"
"*... As for the conscience, we'll print you a new one.*"
The face has disappeared.
Aksat Dzhonatanovich and Dmytro Ivanovich stood straight, looking at each other.

"*What's 'plan shadow'?*" Grip asked.
"*That, Grip, means every kid gets an adult assigned,*"
 Aksat Dzhonatanovich awakened and turned to him.
"*Ow.*"
Dmytro Ivanovich didn't wake up, just brought the pizza to the table
without coming to his senses.
"*How bad is that?*" Grip asked, examining Derevyashko.
"*This changes everything,*" Aksat has dodged the question.
 "*I'd like to see where would we get the budget for all of this.
   By the way, since we're here, we've got a serious discussion ahead.*"

They sat around the table.
Dmytro calculated something complex in his head,
turning more and more similar to his dissociate copy from Epsilon Indi 3.
Aksat Dzhonatanovich eyed him down with disapproval,
but Dmytro ignored the hint, so he had to do the talk himself.
"*OK, I can do it, no problem,*" he grunted.
 "*Something tells me, Grip, that you don't want to work for us any more.*"
"*I want to go home,*" Grip nodded.
"*Goes without saying. I mean, after--*"

Marek peeked into the room and Aksat Dzhonatanovich got distracted:
"*The two of us, urgent.*"
"*Yeah-yeah, I figured,*" he nodded. "*You two go first,
  Stalina-Irakli follow, Grip --- in two days.*"
"*What do you mean, 'in two days'?*" Grip wondered.
"*Medical considerations.*"
"*And what am I supposed to do here?*"
"*If you want to argue, argue with doctor Krolewski,*" Marek dismissed him.
 "*Spare me from this--*"
"*Can I at least get a phone?*"
"*Go annoy comrade envoy about that, I guess.*"
"*Do you want to text your mom?*" Derevyashko awakened. "*I can send it now.*"
"*I want to not get lost? At the very least?
  Like, suppose I go for a walk tomorrow and disappear? What would you do?*"
"*Call the police,*" Marek threatened.
 "*By the next day they'll track you down, for sure. Are we done?*"
"*If I can't have a phone, can we at least get some tea?*"
"*What am I, a butler?
  One day on New Amsterdam, and now he wants a butler,*" Marek mused as he left.

"*So,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich returned to the conversation.
Derevyashko was still solving whatever complex problem it was.
"*Sure, your specialization is quite an exotic one--
  and now, thanks to you, also hardly relevant for a while--*"
"*Have you not noticed that I've ruined everything?
  Smuggled an alien, died and closed a planet?*"
"*Well, if you put it like this, it does sound like a train wreck,*"
 Aksat Dzhonatanovich smiled at him.
 "*Watch and learn: earned the trust of fists and aliens alike,
   manifested commendable initiative, self-sufficiency--
   no, proved capable of highly autonomous--*"
"*Risked his life!*" Irakli Kosmovich added from his faraway corner.
"*--took the responsibility and made a hard decision to...
  now, that I'm not a fan of the outcome, that's a different story.
  Was it at least fun?*"
"*You bet. Will I have to move?*"
"*Yes, to Arkadia. Is that a problem?*"
"*Mom's job... well, dad's as well--*"
"*And who's our mom?*"
"*A scout--*"
"*A geoscout,*" Derevyashko surfaced back for a second.
 "*Uranium. Expeditions, rovers, all that stuff.*"
"*Yup. Maybe I should move after school?*"
"*Yeah,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich sighed.
 "*Mom, these are serious matters. I get it, we need to think about it.*"
"*Can he be my boss?*" Grip pointed at Dmytro Ivanovich.
"*Not any more,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich sighed again.
 "*Only one head over now.
   OK, I see, go home first, get some rest, we'll think this through.*"
"*Can't you just print ten more of him, and that's it? He would be his own--*"
"*No way,*" Dmytro Ivanovich snapped out of it and shook his head.
 "*Never again.*"

Marek returned with a teapot, they opened the pizza boxes and
Dmytro began to thaw back to life.
"*Don't worry that much,*" Marek suggested.
 "*Life goes on, you kept your department and your position,
   what else would you want?*"
"*I would've totally closed you down,*" Stalina remarked.
Everyone has forgotten about her.
"*Why does he need us back so urgently?*" Derevyashko ignored her.
"*He doesn't,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich replied.
 "*It's so that you won't bite your elbows for two days straight.
   Breathe in, breathe out, compose yourself. We're coming home.*"

Grip brought a piece of pizza to Irakli Kosmovich idling in his armchair.
"*No, no, take it,*" he shook his head.
 "*I don't need it, I'll be hopping soon.
   And you've got two more days ahead, doing who knows what.*"
"*Can I ask you, how do you find paper everywhere?*"
 Grip nodded towards the textbook by the armchair.
"*Nothing interesting, really. I've got a friend living here, she brought it.*"
"*Can you leave it to me to read?*"
"*Maybe,*" Irakli Kosmovich let out a cunning smile.
 "*Would you return it to the author for me?*"
"*Me-- author?*" Grip jumped at the cover. "*Uh-- Which one?*"
"*Farah. What a narrow miss for the two of you, second time in a row.
  But I have to warn you, that was a trick question.
  Now, without access to lizards, she'll pick you apart
  and sift through the bones herself, day and night.
  I'd think twice if I were you.*"
"*Are you kidding me? Sounds... interesting, at the very least.
  Of course, I'll bring it to her, no doubt...*"
"*Up to you, lad. You have been warned...*"
Irakli Kosmovich pulled out his phone, pressed something and now stared
at it blankly.
"*Right, and you're off the comms.*"
"*Yeah.*"
"*That way I can't send neither her nor you...
  Yeah. Let's... Oh. Let's do it the old-fashioned way,
  like our ancestors used to do it on Earth,*"
 he reached for the crossword that Thalia hadn't completed.
 "*When I'll get her address, I'll write it down and leave it here,
   then you get there and hand it over.*"
"*Deal. Where did you get this one from?*"
"*Ah, from a newspaper,*" he turned it over to show the front page.
 "*The embassy has a subscription for the third century straight,
   how neat is that?*"

Irakli Kosmovich then rambled at length on how proud he is of Grip and Thalia,
and how everyone should raise their children from now on,
which only made Grip blush.
Derevyashko just said "we'll stay in touch",
Aksat Dzhonatanovich bid no farewell,
and Stalina let out such an insincere "it was nice to work together",
that she'd better kept quiet.
