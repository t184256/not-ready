# (Not) cultured
<!-- ltex: language=en-GB -->

Grip felt awesome.
He escaped the exhausting frenzy and soared in fuzzy warmth.
After what felt like a day of sleep, he could move mountains again.
His entire body felt lighter, ready to spring into action.

The suit went missing.
The room was unfamiliar, cosy and creepy, liveable, but uninhabited.
Hundreds of pictures were plastered around the walls so densely,
it was impossible to throw a pillow without hitting one,
only the corner above his bed was spared from this fate.
Massive furniture did not feature a single straight line,
as if its designer lost a bet or something.
At the foot of the bed there was a bag that mom packed for him:
school uniform, underwear, shoes.
A carafe of water and a glass decorated the table across.
No phone, nothing.

Grip slid behind the heavy curtain to take a look outside.
No snow, no skyscrapers. He was at around third or second floor,
looking at a neighbouring three-storey grey building.
There was, like, fifteen meters of pointless grass between them,
and a fence at least one storey tall.
It wasn't a house across the street, the street was somewhere to the left,
home to some commotion.
A figure in a bright yellow suit was standing in the middle of the street,
people walked past...
all of that was barely visible without opening the window.

As Grip was putting his shoes on, one of the pictures caught his eye,
a person on it, to be specific.
Strangely enough, Ilya Ilyich Svobodin wasn't the centrepiece of the picture.
He extended his hand outwards, trying to make some fat, unpleasant-looking woman
turn around and look the way he wanted.
The woman looked into the camera instead.
Svobodin was much more human than his usual portraits:
an irritated man, but a recognizeable one.

He scanned another dozen of the pictures.
The exhibition revolved around that woman.
Here she is on some construction site, now she's on a porch,
and here she accepts some award.
She was the only one reliably looking at the camera, others mostly didn't.
At least that suggested she was well aware somebody's taking photos of her.
Here she is with a toddler who's, like, three; here's she with a small baby;
and here's with a large entourage --- right, and Svobodin, saw that one already.

Grip sneaked out to the hallway.
Similar rooms to the left... a staircase to the right
looked like a much more promising way out of here.
It then turned left into some...
hall, since it must've featured some enormously tall ceilings,
a hall with yellow light and people chatting.
Pretentious decor and sky-high ceilings made Grip glance upwards
for wax dripping down from candles.
Nope, just your garden variety glowing ceiling.
Meaning this castle must have electricity already.

Grip remembered his lesson and stopped before the turn of the staircase
to tune into the discussion:
"*--all in Stroich's hands now.
  With luck, we're off the hook, worst case we're disbanded.
  Whoever finishes first wins,*" an unknown voice droned.
"*And them?*" Derevyashko asked.
"*What do you think? DoX is, predictably, furious.
  Diplomats are dancing can-can, of course,
  not every year they get such a present.*"
"*No, I mean--*"
"*Not yet, like, why rush it now? A day or two won't make a difference.
  Couldn't you close some other planet?*"
 the voice continued, and Grip began to recall it.
 "*So many of them with no sentient life, just pick any...
   Now you more productive at that than the entire min'o'search has ever been,
   over the entire expanse. In absolute value.*"
Both went quiet to listen to another voice.
Could be Irakli Kosmovich, but Grip couldn't make out a word.
"*And so are we, you know... Ah, forget it,*"
 the other voice continued after a while.
 Grip remembered whose voice it was.
 He was there with them when they departed.
 "*So you're not going to Voronovs?*"
"*Fiona's gonna incinerate me with her gaze. Why are you wondering?*"
"*So, what was this place you were so adamant about?*"
"*--really--*"
"*A haven panorama, you say? Now, after Grip--*"
"*--the burgers, I say. Panorama is great, but not as great as--*"
"*Yuck.*"
"*Doesn't count until you've tasted it.*"
"*I've already agreed, OK? Come out, Grip, it's you spying on us, isn't it?*"

Grip went to the centre of the hall, puzzled about what gave him away.
Aksat Dzhonatanovich and Dmytro Ivanovich sat at a small table,
Irakli Kosmovich read a book in a far corner,
and Stalina Filantievna looked like she passed out on a couch.

"*Hello. Good morning or day.*"
"*Good morning,*" Irakli Kosmovich responded.
"*Hi,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich nodded.
"*Good day,*" Derevyashko greeted him.
"*Are we guests at Thalia's?
  Where's the dragon imprisoned in the tower by the princess?*"
"*You mi--*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich began.
"*Oh no, am I late?*" Grip gasped in mock disappointment. "*Bummer.
  Who's Fiona?*"
"*Thalia's mom. Why a dragon?*" Derevyashko acted curious, as always.
"*Why are we in some kind of castle?*"
 Grip nodded at the ceiling first and chair second.
"*Ah, don't bother. Diplomats are weird. Just in case, I'm the real one.*"
"*Then go ahead,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich nodded.
 "*Instruct him, if you're real.*"
"*What's there to instruct about?*" Derevyashko blanked out.
"*Oh, here we go again,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich turned to Grip himself.
 "*While the law allows for deferring your printing up to seventy-two hours
   without ever explaining anything, you have to be notified afterwards.*"
"*And how long have I been collecting dust?*"
"*Seventy. Now tell me this, what were you thinking with?*"
Derevyashko stared at his lunge disapprovingly.
Grip kept silence for a bit, then grumbled:
"*If you have specific questions, go ahead and ask them.*"
"*There sure will be tons of specific questions later today, at the inquest.
  Just tell me like it is, why did you have to save everyone,
  whenever they wanted to be saved or not?*"
"*Why did you send me then?
  If you wanted me to make decisions, I made the right ones.*"
"*Then get ready to explain how are they the right ones,*"
 Aksat Dzhonatanovich softened under Derevyashko's stink eye.
"*At the inquest?*"
"*Both at the inquest, and to your fans in general.*"
"*To whom?*"

Aksat Dzhonatanovich approached the window and drew the dense curtain open.
Grip jumped up and perched on his hands on the window sill.
First he read the glowing slogans on the protestors' signs.
The following schools of thought dominated the streets:
a bit of "COMMIE DISSOCIATES CLOSED OUR PLANET" here and there,
quite a few variations on "SEND THE SHIPS! NOW!",
but most of them spelled out "FREE THE KIDS".

"*Why in English?*"
"*Welcome to New Amsterdam, Grip Avdotievich.
  You're here for the inquest into your recent achievements--*"
"*And that inquestioning--*"
"*A joint one.*"
"*A-ah.*"
"*The mission was a joint one--*"
"*A-ah.*"
"*--and so is the inquest. Started at ours, ended at theirs.
  And not in the way we planned it to.*"

Done with the signs,
Grip stared at the motley garments and bright hair of the protestors.
The crowd didn't march or anything like Federation ones did,
it didn't look organized at all.
People just stood there, talked to each other, scurried around.
There were many kids among them; someone came with a pram, some kids ran around,
a few sat on their parent's necks, a toddler waved a small sign of his own.
But now the crowd noticed Grip in the window.
A wave washed over the signs, people drifted closer to the building,
shouting something, but Grip didn't hear them, he didn't even look.
His undivided attention went to the greasy fellow at the back,
more specifically,
at the kid who toppled back and tumbled down from his shoulder
as he lurched forward.
Grip screamed internally, but the kid didn't just survive,
she took to her heels and gleefully escaped her hapless parent,
forcing him into chasing her on the other side of the street,
his "FREE THE KIDS" sign swinging in his hand.

"*Climb down, don't instigate the populace for nothing.*"
"*Which side do they want me to climb down?*"
 Grip obeyed and lowered himself to the floor.
"*As if they know what they want.*"
"*Yeah, I think it's clear from the signs
  that they don't know what do they want,*" Grip stepped aside.
Irakli Kosmovich wore a sad smile.
"*Don't worry*," Derevyashko giggled.
 "*The vast majority of them don't want to crucify you--*"
"*Most just want to crucisix?*"
"*--crown you--*"
"*--but why--*"
"*Because,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich couldn't contain himself.
 "*Apparently one can get out of bed, put on their pants, not forget the sign,
   but forget to turn on their heads!*"
"*And how many of them want me back at school, far away from here?*"
"*They might be all united in that, actually,*"
 Dmytro Ivanovich said thoughtfully.
"*Both fans, and fans in the absolute value.
  Do you know what absolute values are? Attaboy.*"

"*OK, and what does our crowd want?* Grip wondered.
Derevyashko snorted quietly.
"*There's no 'our crowd',*" he clarified.
 "*They don't really know much about you.
   And when they will, we'll control the narrative.*"
"*Awesome,*" Grip replied, uplifted. 
 "*What's that 'inquesting' thing, a trial?*"
"*Kind of,*" Derevyashko nodded. "*It's not that straightforward.
  They want to talk before pressing charges,
  so that they know what to accuse you of. And whether they want to.*"
"Free the kids, please. *Oh wait, that means it's inclusive of Thalia?*"
"*Yeah, she's in a similar situation.
  Don't worry, she's got her own support group.*"
"*Oh yeah, I wanna join, give me a sign,*" Grip rolled his eyes.
 "*'Hands off the thistle, people.'*"
"*Why so rude?*" Irakli Kosmovich smiled.
"*Oh, that's a compliment, given her profession.
  She'd be the one standing with a sign until she passes out.*"

"*Somebody explain me one thing,*" Irakli Kosmovich continued.
 "*What makes them think it's their planet to begin with?*"
"*Why, they were the ones who discovered it,*"
 Aksat Dzhonatanovich missed the point.
"*Hello? Lizards called,*" Grip reminded him.
"*Doesn't matter,*", he replied.
 "*There this issue with people: once they consider something theirs,
   they won't part with it. Even if for two of the same.*"
"*Well, now it's time to reconsider,*" Grip insisted.
"*But if there's something cute, they'll drop everything and protect it.
  Whatever singing snails it would be.*"
"*Are there singing snails?*" Derevyashko wondered.
"*--protect some birds,*" Irakli Kosmovich sighed.
"*From what?*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich asked without being specific.
"*From the wind,*" Grip concluded.
"*Yeah, just make a sign about 'protecting snails from the wind',
  and they'll follow. Like I said, zero brain participation--*"
"*I thought we're discussing birds,*" Dmytro Ivanovich spoke absentmindedly.
 "*Who knows what are they chirping about with snails. Could be sentient.
   Let's cede the Earth, just in case.*"
"*Stand down, no need to protect birds,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich clarified.
 "*Everybody knows there are no birds, just secret guard drones.
   And, since they work for the secret guard, that rules out sentience.*"
Someone chuckled behind the wall.
"*Come on, Marek, smack him with something,*"
 Stalina spoke for the first time.

A man who entered the room was a short, though still taller than Grip,
but otherwise rather unassuming. His grey suit only made him blander.
Instead of educating people through violence, he walked to the window
and drew the curtain close.
"*I'd like to ask you to not do this,*"
 his soft voice addressed nobody in particular.
Grip suddenly realized what's wrong with him: his gait, it was too normal.
Marek walked like lower gravity didn't extend to him.

Dmytro Ivanovich was checking his ancient watch.
"*And the minutes? Every time you hop you also...*"
 Grip began to compile a question.
"*... Ah! Yeah, right.
  I have to set it every time anyway, since the time's different.*"
"*Ah, right.*"
"*We're gotta go,*" Derevyashko squirmed, "*So that we don't hurry later.*"
"*I'm going with you,*"
 Grip squatted on his heels, sprang upwards and jumped higher than he stood.
 "*But I need some anchor, like you have,*" he looked at Marek.
  "*Otherwise you set me free and I'll fly away. Like a snail in the wind.*"
His bosses hesitated.
"*Grip, no offence, please...*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich began.
"*Wait, I can't go? Free the kids!*"
"*Why, no, you're free to go where you want--*"
"*First time on New Amsterdam, and go to a burger joint,*"
 Derevyashko shook his head.
 "*That's kinda lame.
   Start with the tourist staples while you've got time:
   parks, Highrise, along the coast--*"
"*Gates!*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich added.
"*Don't go past the Gates though.*"
"*--nah, that one's bigger than Maksimka,*" Marek talked with thin air.
"*Aren't you afraid that I'll run away?*" Grip asked.
"*No--*" Dmytro Ivanovich smiled.
"*Where to? It's New Amsterdam,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich frowned.
 "*There are cams everywhere. But please don't be late for the inquest.*"

"*How would I come out though?*"
 Grip's freedom-induced confidence evaporated.
 "*They're out there,*" he gestured vaguely.
"*Just like this,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich found it funny.
 "*You think these fighters for your freedom won't let you out?
   Also, tell them--*"
"*You'd rather not,*" Marek objected softly.
"*Yeah, by the way,*" Derevyashko addressed him.
 "*Could you give us a car, or a lift?*"
"*You can just use the subway,*" Marek shrugged. "*Let me--*"
"*Oh really? Nice.*"

But first they let a woman into the room.
She was similarly short
and disrespectful to the local gravitational customs and traditions.
"*Come in,*" she unfolded a long black trench coat in front of Grip.
It weighed about as much as Grip himself, greatly restricting his movement.
"*See! It fits alright,*" she exclaimed.
"*And where would I go to in this?...*"
"*Let's go to a mall,*" she suggested. "*That'd take the rest of day.*"
Grip knew this word, but it translated as a "shopping centre",
which didn't spark any joy.
Getting stuck there for the entire day was even less appealing.
The coat worked wonders against compulsive shrugging.
"*Nah. I don't want to.*"
"*Whatever,*" she replied and left.

Grip walked around the room, sat down.
The book's stylish cover caught his eye.
"*Irakli Kosmovich, is that a textbook?*"
He raised it higher, so that it's visible more clearly.
The back featured a giant "[do-think]", the front had a matching "[signs']".
But that made them rotated wrong. Like in school.
"*Yes, a fresh one.*"
"*Isn't it a bit too late for you?*"
"*It's never too late to study,*" he made notes right in the book.
 "*They waste no time either, now they're teaching kids to think in lizard.
   Have you ever?*"
"*In isolated words,*" Grip reflected. "*How else would I think about them?
  I can think in English, as long as I don't run out of words,
  but lizard has very few of them.*"
"*Isolated words, is it rattling or translations?*"
"*Translations.*"
"*And they want to cut straight to rattling... Sounds ambitious.*"
"*We didn't study sounds at all, I just... And you, do you think? In lizard.*"
"*I also don't rattle inside my head,
  it's enough for me to know the bijection exists...
  I pronounce the bases in English,
  but I also spell out each link and stroke separately, in their writing order,
  not the newfangled way...
  So, take you, Thalia and me, we all pronounce it differently.*"
"*Interesting... Do they teach how to write in joint? Outwards.
  That's something we needed right away.*"
"*You know, they do not, for some reason...*"
"*Do you want to go for a walk?*"
"*Sorry, not really. I've been here before, I don't think it has changed much.*"

With no company, no phone-- no watch, even, --Grip didn't want to
roam who knows where. So he just sat there in this iron coat.

"*Are you gonna sit here, like a poor cousin?*" Marek came back.
 "*Don't wanna go to the mall? Pay Voronovs a visit. A friend, after all.*"
"*Voronovs? Are we allowed to?
  I mean, shouldn't they separate and interrogate us one by one?*"
"*What? No, nothing like this. They'll bring you together anyway.*"
"*Do I have the time to?*"
"*Yeah, even if you walk, they live nearby.*"
"*Won't Thalia's mother ignite me with her gaze?*"
"*Sheesh!*" Marek was amused. "*Fiona is a lady of exquisite manners,
  rest assured she's incapable of igniting anyone. Only pressing.
  Do you know Fiona as well?*"
"*No, just Martin--*"
"*O-oh, come one, why be so shy then? It's Martin Aleksandrovich,
  an all-around larger-than-life sweetie pie.
  Especially since you know each other already.*"
Grip blanked out for a while.
He was busy applying "larger-than-life" and "sweetie pie"
to the respectable, reserved man who hasn't even said a word around him.
"*Are you sure we're talking about the same Martin Aleksandrovich?*"
 he doubted in the quiet.
"*One is enough,*" Marek didn't understand him.
 "*Where have you seen him, Federation?*
"*Yeah, on Arkadia.*"
"*Well, that explains it. He's, obviously, not welcome there,
  no wonder he wore a sour face.*"
A "sour face" fit Grip's idea of Thalia's dad about as well
as "larger-than-life" and "sweetie pie".

"*Alright,*" Grip made the decision.
 "*Will you show me the way? Cause I don't have a--*"
"*Why, off-peak, we can accompany you there... that'd be easier.
  Lora, could you walk this fella to Voronovs?*"
The same woman has entered the room, as if she was waiting for the invitation,
but only to glance at Grip sceptically.
"*You do need a cap after all. I'll go find something.*
And disappeared again.
"*Why would I need a cap?*" Grip wondered.
"*So that you're less recognizeable?*" Marek speculated.
 "*Won't hurt to wear one.*"

Lora caught up with them at the lower levels,
in hallways that didn't look even a tiny bit residential,
and handed Grip a round shiny black cap.
"*Let me join you for this walk, actually,*"
 Marek said, examining Lora intently.

The hallways ended with a door, and, behind that door, a large party
ate a watermelon:
"Hi!"
"Hello!"
"Is it him?"
Marek silently nodded at them without slowing down,
until he crossed the room and led Grip to another, shorter hallway.
Another door, and the passenger flow carried them away.

In the carriage Grip stood overlooking an entire row of phones,
and, suddenly, saw Thalia in one of them, and then both of them,
giving a speech together. Some lame desert shots, a lizard,
some girl skipping a jump rope, something's driving away...
His five seconds of fame.
Grip turned his back to the phone owner, just in case.

They left shortly after.
Grip stared everywhere at once,
and the more ads he saw, the less he understood Fist ads.
Flashy, bright, memorable,
they called for nothing and informed him of nothing.
"A good night's sleep", or even just the green "this side"
left him with absolutely nothing actionable.

They're finally outside.
The fences here were shorter,
protecting from curious stares, not from jumping over them.
Smaller houses stood far away from each other.
With a housing density so low, where did the people live?
Must've been the cars?
Absurdly low, they either stood still for long, or crawled so slowly,
Grip just couldn't see them as a threat.
They were part of the landscape, flowing like a wide river,
they were the real New Amsterdam.

Pedestrians had to stay within narrow pavements;
so narrow, that they waited in line for another street light:
Marek in the front, Grip, then Lora.
And Marek said, looking straight in front of him, barely audibly:
"*What'chu up to?*
"*What, me, nothing,*" her answer was much easier to make out for Grip.
"*Oh, come on. How long do we know each other for, a decade?*"
"*Not continuously.*"

Green light came on and they crossed the road.
But Marek stopped shortly after:
"*If you think I'll just let it slide, think again. What's that under the coat?
  Give it to me.*"
Lora handed over some bright magazine.
Marek yanked it from her hands,
and she dutifully turned around to monitor the surroundings.

The last one who Grip recognized from the cover art was himself.
Also, Irakli Kosmovich wasn't that old, Stalina Filantievna wasn't that burly,
Lisa and Maria didn't look that much alike and, most of all,
Thalia wasn't such a monster.
Skinny as a pole, she lost all fat, all the colour of her face
and quite some teeth. Definitely the main villain of this comic book.

"*Look, ma, I'm on TV. Help,*" Grip scratched his nose, befuddled.
 "*Could I have a copy?*"
"*Not finding a copy for you, that'd be unthinkable...*"
 Marek finished skimming through the book.
"*Because, what guests would we be, without a present?*"
"*Where did you find it so quickly? Maksimka?*"
"*Took it from Maksimka...*" Lora confirmed.
"*Laura Remsovna!*" Marek raised his voice.
 "*Took a comic book from a kid. Now you chase another one for profit.*"
"*What profit? I'm penniless.*"
"*--Admit it, you wanted him to sign it.*"
Grip covered his face with both hands and let out a silent scream.
"*OK, so, we're confiscating the evidence,*"
 Marek waited for Grip to look at him again
 and continued in a secretive voice.
 "*But I can't escort with my hands full,
   so Grip will be the one to carry it.
   Not lose it somewhere, not ruin it somehow,
   and hand it back to me this very evening. Deal?*"
"*Will do!*"
"*And you, we'll have a word with you later.*
Now it was Grip's turn to skim through the comic book:
"*Can we ask this Maksimka guy where to find one?*"
"*Can't buy one here.*"
"*But where? Where can I buy one?*"
"*Fed. It's our doing,*" Marek resumed walking. "*Hold on to this one for now,
  and ask your boss later.*"
"*Oh the horror,*" Grip was catching up with him, eyes on the cover art.
 "*I'll write-- I'll write everything,
   I'll write to partcom, I'll write to plancom, I'll write everywhere...*"

Just a couple of houses later Marek turned right and opened the gate.
They went up the porch
and Martin Aleksandrovich opened the door almost right away,
in a flower-patterned apron and
his hand in flour raised to the side unnaturally:
"*Pertsev! And you-- oh, hello,*" he addressed Grip now.
Grip waived him hello with the comic book:
"*Star duo! Reunion! Have you ordered one?*"
"*Thalia!*" he turned to the side to shout.
 "*You've got guests! Come in, come--*"
"*No-no, we're just escorting Grip, we're--*" Marek shook his head.
"*Oh yeah? Are you abandoning me?*" Grip stared at him.
 "*Such an invaluable expert? Surrounded by enemies?*"
"*To be torn apart by a defector and a terrorist,*"
 Martin Aleksandrovich echoed him. "*Tal!*"
"*Tell them the* kids *are* free *now*",
 Grip instructed them and entered the house.
"*Hang it here,*" Martin showed him a flimsy hook and closed the door.
"*Would it hold--*" Grip had doubts about that hook.
"*Fiona, we have a guest!*" Martin left him behind.
Grip's shoulders hurt, walking without the coat was inconvenient.
He left the coat standing in the corner and hurried to catch up with
the host of another castle.
Grip didn't feel ready for indoors running.

Martin Aleksandrovich awaited him in another two-storey hall:
"Allow me to introduce you to Fiona, my spouse and Thalia's mother."
He gestured towards a slender white figure
gracing a side-table with her presence,
sipping from a tiny cup with painfully pretentious elegance.
But it wasn't her inhumanely straight back or her pompous hair
that stumped Grip. It was the long white dress that left no room for doubt.
Fists or feds, the cultural code was clear.
This woman was getting married today.

"Fiona, this is Grip, Tal's latest partner in crime."
"Nice to meet you,"
 the well-drilled phrase rolled off his tongue,
 and only then Grip's brain caught up with Martin's introduction.
 And blanked out. Hard.
"Nice to meet you too, young man."
She lowered the cup and gave him
a debilitatingly judgmental stare... and kept it lowered,
awaiting whatever the etiquette prescribed Grip to do next?
Well, tough luck, because at the moment
a deer in the headlights would've been a more capable conversationalist.

The stalemate was resolved in a few seconds
as light steps approached them hastily,
providing Grip an excuse to avert his eyes towards--
they've got a spiral? staircase?? smack in the middle of the room???
--a smaller slender white-dress-toting figure gliding down the stairs
with graceful toework only possible on low gravity planets.

"Thalia, dear, you have a guest. Please, greet him like a true lady you are."
A younger bride, who just reached the floor, ceremonially bowed at Grip:
"Pleased to meet you," she greeted him melodically.
"I'm not gonna marry your daughter,"
 Grip said out loud,
 further cementing his inferiority to the proverbial deer
 when it comes to rhetorical prowess.
 And then, as everyone was processing that, topped it off with a:
 "Blink twice if you were tortured."

"Excuse me?!"
 Fiona blushed in shock so utter, her cup has slightly tilted sideways.
But Grip didn't even look her way, as Thalia was almost there,
whether it was to rescue or murder him on the spot.
It wasn't clear from her facial expression, OK?

"He's joking, mummy,"
 Thalia yanked his hand so hard, she basically sent him flying her way.
 "Let's go" she cooed tenderly
 as he focused on not being dragged on the floor,
 but rather following her at his own will.

Upstairs, Thalia stopped and stared at Grip, fuming.
He expected the familiar hissing, but she spoke clearly, quickly and quietly:
"*Never-- you hear me-- never discuss in front of my mom whom I should marry!
  Or shouldn't! Understood?*"
"*Yeah-yeah, I get it,*" Grip nodded, disoriented.
"*And what's that thing?*" she turned to the comic book. "*Oh no.*"
"*Oh yeah,*" Grip grinned, handing it to her.
"*Oh no,*" she echoed herself, but took the comic book and headed to a room.

Grip has stopped at the door involuntarily to scan the room.
A giant bed in the centre of it, as if to sleep across it.
Everything is white, save for a tiny black backpack under the window.
The room was in perfect order, maybe everything was in that wall-sized wardrobe?
One could even call the interior spartan and ascetic,
if it weren't for the statues.
Four life-sized statues in one room, one for each corner,
that was an overkill.
"*And... This...*"
"*Don't mind it,*" Thalia plopped on the bed with the comic book in her hands.
 "*Mummy's ideas on style-- status --are stuck in the twenty-second century
   or something.*"

Grip was already fighting her for control of the page-turning.
"*They really did you dirty...*"
"*Uh. Whatever. That's an... established image by now.*"
The very first page: somebody in black uniform is taking him from the classroom,
right from the lizard lesson and Maria Stepanovna, drawn funny--
"*Was it really like this?*"
"*Almost, really,*" Grip shrugged.
--by the end of the second page they're on Arkadia, giving the speech;
and on the third one he rises up from a shiny teleport,
handing everyone instructions left and right.
"*Hey!*"
"*Wait, you wanted them to draw you unconscious?*"
 Thalia had the fun of her life.
 "*Or a rustier teleport?*"
"*No, why am I commanding everyone?*"
"*Eh, big deal, they're getting slightly ahead of themselves,*" she mocked him.
"*And why in the world I'm in school uniform?*
"*Ow.*"
"*At least you're in shorts!*"
The very idea of walking around the base in school uniform made him sweat,
and they haven't yet reached the page where he put on a spacesuit on top of it
to walk to the middle of the desert to chat with lizards.
The comic book really skimped on sandwriting.
By the time they got to the only panel
where he wrote in the sand with his right hand,
and kept Thalia away from the discussion with his left hand,
Grip gave up on articulating his complaints
and just groaned with disappointment.

Whoever drew that comic book, they knew everything that happened at the base,
and then decided to draw something else entirely.
At the same time, they clearly had no idea of what was happening in the dome
--- the comic book didn't as much as hint at the existence of the dome.
After his triumphant return ("There will be a second meeting!")
Grip stopped Thalia from starting anew and eagerly read the publication data.

> Author: A. Ya. Sergiyuk. Illustrator: I. Ya. Sergiyuk.

What are they, sisters?

They read the comic book again, studying every corner of it.

"*Lame.*"
"*Yeah.*"
"*Listen, have you already? Read all your laws?*"
"*Do I look like an idiot?--*"
"*--Erm, how should I--*"
"*Don't test me, immortal. There, the comms were down. Here, I've got lawyers.*"
"*Makes sense. And what do they say?*"
"*Same old. If they want to, they'll convict me. That's how it goes here,
  whoever has--*"
"*A cooler story?*" Grip nodded towards the comic book.
"*More expensive lawyers. And the popular opinion--*"
"*Oh, I saw a crowd who wants to either jail or free me--*"
"*Well, duh! First they need to jail you to free you,*" she laughed.
"*Yeah, they haven't exactly made up their minds yet,*" Grip snickered as well.
 "*On one hand, they're angry that I've closed the planet they--*"
"*Hey! How about me?*" Thalia laughed out loud.
"*And you're free, my dear.*"
"*We'll see. In issue four. Who closed the planet.
  A komsomolets-pioneer? Or a Fist spy?*"
 she prodded the cover, fighting laughter.
 "*Tell them to go on. Keep drawing.*"
"*Or what?*" Grip snorted.
 "*You're gonna come for them? Through the gap under their door?*
"*Who do you think I am, Mit'ka?*"
"*Who?*"
"*Infiltra...teur?*" Thalia made up a new word.
 "*Another one of your open agents.*"
"*I don't know any. I know one infiltrateur, but he stayed on Epsilon Indi 3.*"
"*Never mind.*"
"*Oh, I won't. I'll be like your crowd. Not a single thought.*"
"*They don't know a thing.
  Nothing has been officially announced yet, but the entire planet thinks
  we've closed the planet so that we don't put lizards into their heads.*"
"*A-a-a, how do they imagine that?*"
"*Badly.*"
"*That I can see!
  My statue with a lizard is turning into...*" Grip flailed his arms.

"*How long since you've been printed?*"
"*Just now. Waited for seventy hours. Glad that they did print me after all.*"
"*Nah, they haven't stooped that low yet.
  Don't worry. You'll come back. No matter what you do.
  How's your mom?*
"*I don't know.*"
"*Wait,*" she stopped laughing. "*They didn't give you a phone?*"
"*They didn't.*"
"*Have you asked for one?*"
"*No. What would I write her anyway? Mom, I've got a tribunal in--*"
"*I've got a tribunal--*"
"*I don't think she's well versed in that. So, what do I need a phone for?
  You're the only one I know.*"

"*Now I also want one--,*" she tapped the comic book.
"*My signature?*" Grip laughed.
"*What? A comic book. You're not giving me that one, are you?*"
"*No, that's evidence,*" Grip stretched out the words, well-pleased.
"*What are you talking--*"
"*These folks who escorted me here...*"
"*Guards?*"
"*Maybe?*"
"*Short, heavy-footed--*"
"*Yeah-yeah, got one from their son? Maybe.
  And now it's one's evidence against the other.*"
"*What?*"
"*You thought I was joking? About the signature?
  Some Maksimka guy, he had this--*"
"*Which Maksimka, Tereschenko?*"
"*How would I know?
  A gal took it from some Maksimka and wanted me to sign it.*"
"*So what?*"
"*I don't know, some devious plan. But she hid it from the other one,
  I don't know who he is, a husband or a brother.*"
"*Ah! You're federates. Now I get it.*"
"*OK, you get it --- you tell it.*"
"*Maksimka Tereschenko is the ambassador's son--*"
"*And these two are his guards?*"
"*Uh, no, just, guards,*" Thalia blinked.
 "*Wanted you to sign it for extra value.*"
"*Why are they short then?*"
"*What do you mean, why?*" she giggled. "*What if Svobodin arrives?
  And they're taller than he. And Tereschenko isn't exactly tall either.*"
"*Do they offer third hand attachments here?*"
 Grip asked from behind a double facepalm.
 "*I'm running out of them hands.
   Maybe the comic writers could draw me an extra one.
   So, they're shortening people? Just for--*"
"*Ew! Gross! No. I don't think so.
  Is there a shortage of short people or what?*"
"*Hmm.*"

"*Nah, you don't need a third hand, I bet they don't know what to do with you
  and your existing ones,*" Thalia gloated.
"*You'll kill me, eat me and drink the blood,*" Grip laughed.
 "*Just be careful with the stains, you know, a white dress.
   Why do you think you're so slender? No pioneer meat--*"
"*Come on, that's not heroic. Just look at this handsome hero.
  A handsome hero like this could only die for the noblest of the causes,*"
  Thalia tried to suppress laughter.
"*My handsome hero dies in act three anyway!
  Without any cause whatsoever. OK, with a cause, but from stupidity.
  This way would actually be more heroic.
  After all, slain by the hand of my mortal enemy--*"
"*Mortal enemy?*" she either got offended or pretended to.
 "*Mortal enemy, you say? Come here, and I'll show you--*"
"*Hey-- hey! Can true ladies-- behave like this?*"
 Grip dodged a slap, laughing. "*Is it even legal?*"
"*Time for dinner, true lady,*" Martin smiled at them from the hallway.
"*Do you feed gentlemen in this house?*"
"*You bet. You don't even imagine how little do these two peck.*"
"*Have you tried loosening their dresses?*"
"*No loosening of dresses in this house,*" he joked before disappearing.
"*Can I leave the book here?*"
"*Oh, sure,*" Thalia adjusted her dress.
 "*Don't give mummy reasons to worry about.*"

At the dinner table, Grip kept a low profile at first,
discreetly observing Thalia and Fiona, and then decided to go for it.
Why not play this game?
Back? Straight. Face? Bland. Attention? To the others.
Smile? Stretch it, stretch it, stretch some more. Stares from Thalia? Ignore.
Now if he could only recall every single posh word he's ever heard...

Martin Aleksandrovich waltzed out of the kitchen with a large tray
and circled the table.
Grip was pleased to notice the host do the exact same thing
he was doing for the last half a minute:
glancing at their straight backs and raised chins,
listening to the ringing silence and, in general,
trying to discreetly guess what kind of game are they playing today.
Except that Martin gave up in the end and just sat down to eat.
"Bon appétit," Fiona announced, and the system set into motion.
Grip stayed as silent as Thalia was, mirrored her grip on the fork
and just had fun in general.
Martin Aleksandrovich gave them one last confused look
and focused on his food.

"Doctor Behring called," Fiona struck up a conversation.
 "Said you missed every single check-up this year."
"Mummy!"
 Thalia hissed the way Grip was so used to by now,
 without changing her benign pose a single bit.
 "Where are your manners?
  Just send him the scan, you just happen to be in possession of a fresh one."
"My dear, this isn't just about a scan!
 I had high hopes for him talking a modicum of sense into you
 in regard to all this nastiness you consume on your so-called missions--"
"So now this does constitute an acceptable dinner talk topic?"
"How do you find the fricassee?" Martin addressed the guest hastily.
"It's delicious," Grip replied with reserved fervour.
 "I haven't eaten solid food for days."
"There's more of it, but there's also fish," Martin smiled.
"And I have zero doubt that it would be just as exquisite,"
 Grip replied, marvelling internally at his newly discovered
 word stringing abilities.
The ladies went quiet.

"And how do you find New Amsterdam?"
"I didn't really have a chance to check it out, unfortunately.
 It was only today when I arrived,
 and, to this moment, I'm still unsure about my ability to explore in safety."
By the end of the phrase, most of his brain was busy celebrating.
"How unfortunate," Fiona stated.
 "I hope you'll be able to alleviate this preposterous inconvenience.
  There's so much to see here."
A small cube of food dropped from Martin Aleksandrovich's fork,
and he immediately picked it back, unfazed.
"I'm afraid," Grip continued,
 "That many people took closing of the planet too close to heart."
"Let's abstain from discussing work and politics at the table,"
 she suggested meekly.
The uncontrolled ascent of Grip's eyebrows
brought him dangerously close to stepping out of character.
He stared at Thalia; Thalia stared past him, past everyone, straight ahead.
The side of the chair in front of her did not go up in smoke.
"Thalia, darling, would you accompany our guest?"
"I'll be right back," Martin Aleksandrovich went to bring the fish.
"With great pleasure," Thalia chirped.
 "I hope you have enough time at your disposal for everything you have in mind."
"Right, time. I've got exactly the same amount as you."
"Indeed," she grazed him a heavy stare.
 "Then I suppose,
  you could proceed with your exploration once you're done with the in--"
  she checked herself.
"Tasty, isn't it?" Grip nodded at her.
"As always," she muttered and everybody focused on the food for a while.
"So, what's next for you?" Fiona wondered.
"Fiona, sweetie,"
 Martin Aleksandrovich couldn't refrain from commenting on his way back.
 "Our guest, a pupil, an open agent, has arrived to stand trial.
  How is he supposed to answer your question,
  while simultaneously avoiding both politics and work?"
"Ice cream! I definitely plan to get my hands on some--"
"We've got some! I'll bring some," Martin Aleksandrovich nodded.
"--aside from the... aforementioned topics."

The ladies withdrew into themselves and temporarily ceased all attempts
at striking up a conversation.
This time Martin Aleksandrovich brought an entire vase full of colourful
balls of ice cream, plus three ice cream bowls. Fiona didn't get one.
"Do you dislike ice cream?" Grip asked.
"I'm watching my waistline, so, ice cream's for festive occasions only.
 Something that Martin is fully aware of," she kindly replied.
Grip nodded, deep in his thoughts.
He was weighing what does he want more:
 somehow translating and asking
 "*would you mind sharing the, without a doubt,
   one breathtaking story of how did you two manage to meet each other*"
 or living to see another day.

"So, do you feel completely disoriented?"
 Martin Aleksandrovich asked right after sitting down.
"Do you want an honest answer? Or--"
"Tell it like it is, I think I'll understand."
"Let's say I'm puzzled."
"We're still discussing the planet, aren't we?"
 Martin Aleksandrovich made no effort to pretend he's not having fun.
"Sure, definitely, the planet."
"I know that it feels intimidating and totally different at first,
 but it's very much like Arkadia at heart, just not on the surface."
"Well, then, I'm afraid, I lack a suitable reference point."
 Grip dusted off and applied one flowery word after another.
"Yeah?" Thalia's dad frowned. "Why did I think you're from Arkadia then?"
"That's simple to explain," Grip bobbed his head.
 "That's where we had the pleasure to meet for the first time,
  but that was just... in transit."
"Was it? And you're from..."
"Rosario. Mining, uranium," he added.
"OK, I take it back,"
 unconstrained with the boundaries of etiquette,
 Martin Aleksandrovich spread his hands.
 "I have no idea what you feel right now."
"I think that's... a more accurate assessment,"
 there still were new words left in the corners of his mind.
"People are people, that holds up everywhere. You just need to adjust."
"So far I haven't decided yet on whether to adjust or to run away."
"Anyway, I'm here to help if you--"
"You know a path?"

Grip felt Fiona's heavy stare with his ear.
As he turned his head towards her, the stare slid across his face.
"Could you kindly postpone these until after dinner?"
 she warbled. "I could leave you to discuss that."
"Sure, sure" he bowed his head in a nod.
 "Please accept my apologies, it was no further than several hours ago
  that I was neck deep in my work, and I haven't completely adjusted back yet."
"Apologies accepted," she softened up.
"Dear Madam, have you ever been told before that your looks are heavy?"
"On multiple occasions, in fact,"
 she must've worn the same creepy smile to each of those occasions.
Thalia's pale face expressed firm commitment to
leave the planet at the earliest opportunity
and dedicate the rest of her life to saving every single snail out there,
singing or not.

* * *

"*Listen, friend,*"
 back in the bedroom, Grip examined the statues again,
 and remembered Thalia's Epsilon Indy 3 decorations.
 "*A question. Those two, how did they, um, how did their paths cross?
   I'm just curious about how a man from Arkadia could cross paths
   with a person, who has all these other people standing in her bedroom?
   Stone people?*"
"*So creepy, isn't it?*"
 Thalia wondered quietly with Newt-like ambiguity,
 referring to either statues, the dinner, her mom or who else knows what.
"*It's... strange, rather,*" Grip proceeded with a vague reply.
"*My dad is a defector,*"
"*Right, that's the bit I know.*"
"*My grandfather is the boss of your boss's boss.*"
"*The father of your father is a boss of an-- a-a-a...*"
"*You still haven't read a thing?*
"*I told you! No phone! Where would I read that? Nothing in the comic book--*"
"*--really something... Do you know Svobodin at least?*"
"*Thank goodness, not in person.*"
"*Watch out, another stunt like this, and it could end--*"
"*Wait, wait, you've got statues watching over you,
  and I woke up today to Svobodin's photos on the walls. Creepy!*"
"*You have his portraits in every office--*"
"*--but not bedrooms, for--*"
"*--and here it's photos. In a bedroom,*" Thalia mocked him.
 "*Understandable. That's unusual.*"

"*Grandpa--*" Grip reminded her.
"*Defence Minister, Renat Stroich Kirenko, reports directly to Svobodin.
  Then the head of foreign intelligence, Aksat Dzhonatanovich's boss--*"
"*--your grandpa--*"
"*--so his son followed in his steps, and he liked it here.
  And he somehow defected in a way that grandpa could get away with it.
  You're sitting high, by the way.*"
"*The funnier the fall.
  So, is it the part where citizen Voronov meets lady Voronova?*"
"*She's* Strange. As in Strange Logistics."
"*Uh, OK, but how did they meet?*"
"*Some dinner party. Dad was fresh out of the Federation, so exotic, so he--*"
"*Exotic?* Grip snorted. "*The most normal one out of all--*"
"*Don't you fall for that...*" Thalia's hand ran across her face.
 "*So, now you're thinking how I came to be the way I am?*"
"*No, how do they get along.*"
"*Easy, mummy loves daddy very much. And puts up with all his antics.*"
"*A woman of great patience.*"
"*She?! Not me?!*" Thalia managed to say with just the look of her face.
"*With a mummy like this, you shouldn't skip any doctor's visits.*"
"*Very funny,*" Thalia pouted. "*Yes, my therapist is very well-off.*"
"*Your... therapist?... Do you have a personal gardener as well?*"
"*For that I'd first need a personal garden, wouldn't I,*"
 she replied, absentmindedly,
 and reached out for a phone with a frown on her face.
"*What happened, is it time to go?*"
"*Yeah, soon. Just wait.*"
A minute later she tilted her phone and smiled.
"*Yesterday. They set your dad free yesterday.*"
"*Good,*" Grip said, reserved. And this time, he went on.
 "*As long as they don't lock him back up now.
   Just like that, you tell a fairy tale to the wrong---
   Kolobok, that'd be the only one I'll ever tell my kids, just in case.
   And you, uh, give me my colleague back,
   the only place you can don that dress to is down the aisle.*"
"*As if I'd ever leave the house dressed like this...*"
Thalia disappeared into the closet,
leaving Grip to wonder whose bedroom is it.

"*Go, go, go. Commence evasive manoeuvres,*"
 the familiar evil Thalia jumped out the closet,
 grabbed the comics and sprinted out.
 "*Mom, dad! We're out!*"
"*So soon?*" came from downstairs,
 making Thalia abruptly change course based on the new intelligence.

* * *

"*... your mom needs the superpower to push and ignite by just staring,
  Irakli Kosmovich --- to procure paper out of thin air,
  me --- a coat like this one--*"
"*And me?*"
"*You need to eat up, eat up and eat up some more.*"
"*How about this one, can you guess what's sold here?*"
Grip approached the yellow circles, peered into the dark room...
"*It's just cheese,*" he returned to the pavement.
 "*Big deal. A shop for cheese.*"
"*Yeah, right,*" Thalia sneered.
 "*As if you don't have shops with only sausages in stock.*"

They went quiet: the street ahead was the blocked one with the embassy.
A bright yellow figure watched them, half-leaning, half-sitting on the car
with "POLICE" written all over it.
Grip adjusted his coat, pulled his hat lower. Thalia just sped up.
The crowd of protestors against who-knows-what got thinner.
While they were distracted with Marek leaving the building,
the kids went along the street just fine. But then they got recognized.
One person started filming them without a word, a second one, a third one...
The crowd stirred, parted to take better videos;
some approached them, but didn't want to meddle with the kids.
"Free the kids!" Grip barked.
One five-year old ran towards them, blocking Grip's path,
grabbed his sleeve and just stared, mouth agape.
Grip grabbed his hand in return and briefly shook hands with him
as he skirted around the boy, leaving him to stare at his hand.
"*Over here!*"
Marek opened the gate and everybody set off to run somewhere,
but it was too late. Grip and Thalia broke stride and dashed for safety,
Marek showed a couple of people away unceremoniously and closed the gate,
then they ran up the steps and hid behind the door.

"*Give it to me!*"
Once inside, Grip was stared up by some chubby ill-tempered eight-year old,
his hand stretched out demandingly.
Grip folded the comic book to lightly bonk him at his head.
The boy froze for a split second before snatching the book and running away.
"*What was that?*" Marek reproached Grip.
"*Who was that, what did he want?*"
"*Maksimka, the ambassador's son,*" Thalia replied enthusiastically.
"Oops," Grip pursed his lips.
"*A son or not, that wasn't nice of you,*" Marek concluded.
 "*Apologies are due, so, next time you meet you'd rather--*"
"*Yeah, that came out awkward,*"
 Grip agreed, looking where to place Maksimka's coat,
 while Thalia has marched straight to the hall.
"*Why did you bring her here?*"
"*Where else would--*"

"*What do you think you're doing here?*" she lashed out on them right away.
"*Oh!*"
"*We were expecting you,*"
Irakli Kosmovich turned his phone towards the group.
@"Voronov works for communists" was the headline.
"*Yeah, hello to you as well,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich greeted her.
"*Which Voronov?*" Grip grinned. "*Could they be more specific--*"
"*Did you even plan to tell him about his dad?*"
"*We were planning to. Right after the inquest.*"
"*Then why don't you give him a phone? Got something else to hide?*"
"*Oh, that's not us, that's your stupid laws,*"
 Aksat Dzhonatanovich parried with great relief.
"*What laws?*"
"*The ones that don't let kids have phones.*"
"*Oh really? Explain this then!*" Thalia waved her phone in his face.
"*And this one's your mom's, dad's or even a company one,*" he replied.
But the topic has changed since: Thalia noticed Stalina Filantievna.
"*And what's that?*" she shrieked. "*What did she do to you?*"
"*Was it us who didn't approve her* permit *up until we've printed her?*"
"*--defender bestowed upon me,*" Stalina Filantievna groaned.
 "*Shoo. Find yourself some snails and defend them instead.*"
"*What snails?*"
"*From the wind,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich response was doubly out of place.
"*If you're here, where's Dmytro Ivanovich?* Grip changed the subject.
"*Showers.* New Amsterdam *welcomed him with an extra portion of tomato sauce.*"
"*Brr. And we had a comic drawn about us!*"
"*--oh yeah--*"
"*Though she, basically, got reduced to pigtails--*"

* * *

"*And where to?*" Stalina shifted to sitting.
"*They don't tell,*" Irakli Kosmovich looked up from the book.
"*They don't want the press to know,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich nodded.
"*... where they shouldn't have run to?*" Grip inserted.
"*And how's that an open hearing?*" Stalina frowned.
"*They could publish a recording in the end, and it'd still count,*"
 Irakli Kosmovich shrugged.
"*Anyway, wherever it is, can't be far from here.*"
Thalia put down the crossword to look at the phone.
Derevyashko glanced at his watch.
"*Yeah, yeah, get ready,*" Marek remarked as he strode past the door.
 "*Soon.*"

* * *

Stalina Filantievna's movements were frightening,
as if she was constantly being shocked.
Two long, low limousines drove up to the entrance.
They stood diagonally across the street,
with tens of yellow policemen scurrying around them.
"*How are we gonna drive through that, chief?*" Derevyashko shouted.
"*Over here,*" Marek led them between the cars. "*Follow me.*"
He gave those entrusted to him another glance
and rushed to open the gate across the street.
The journalists that stepped aside to calculate where to go next,
stormed the cars again.

The plaque on the building across said "Institute of hybrid law enforcement".
The doors opened into a large hallway,
where a white-haired old man greeted them warmly.
But Grip missed his speech entirely, rushing towards a tall figure further away.
"Colleague!"
"Dan!"
Up close, the figure indeed turned out to be Dan, as seen from below.
Moreover, in the flesh, he turned out not just much darker,
but also, like, three heads taller than Grip imagined him to be.
"So we do meet again after all!" Dan bent down to shake Grip's hand.
"Nice to see! The pixels, alive! Is Lee also here, maybe?"
"No," Dan shook his head.
 "At least they had the decency to not drag him into this."
"Good."
"Well, Lee did nothing wrong!"
"Yeah, that's true."
"Hello-hello," Lisa waived at Grip.
"No wandering away, follow me," the old man ordered them around.
 "Or upstairs and the first room on the left, for those who just can't wait."

The giant room was all topsy-turvy.
Steep rows of seats towered around, dozens of them, all empty;
instead they took seats at the table below according to the nameplates.
The table itself would make sense, were it curved the other way.
Or if the chairs were on the other side of it,
though then they'll be facing the wall instead of the missing audience.
Because of that stupid curve, Grip saw almost no one from his central seat,
but Maria to the left and Stalina to the right.
Besides the nameplate, there were glasses of water, some notepads and pens...

The last two to enter the room were the two "twin teen toons",
a grotesque couple Grip spotted along the way.
Same eye shape, same mannerism-- it was easier to list what differed:
their hair, a bit, their garments, a lot.
The business suit of the blue one with a cyan fist on the lapel
earned just a passing glance from Grip.
Now, the suit of the red one, on the other hand,
once he deciphered the author's intent--
Oh, that'd be hilarious to bring mom such coveralls,
just to see the look on her face.
And were she to wear it to work,
the entire seventeenth search group would tear their bellies from laughing.
That wasn't exactly conductive to taking the inquest seriously.

Just as the blue one began to talk in English,
loud knocking interrupted her.
Grip leaned back on the chair and twisted himself
to see it was just Derevyashko who dropped the earphones.
"*I'm sorry, excuse me...*"
Grip jumped at the pile of stuff in front of him
to fish out an earphone for himself.
It featured a translation.
"... the presence of which in Lisa Frei and Maria Stinner's actions,
 might suggest the following: instigating a suicide pact, assisting suicide,
 and criminal sabotage."
"*We're holding an inquest,*" the red one commenced.
 "*into the consequences of the actions of Grip Avdotievich Stavropolskiy,
   Stalina Filantievna Ivanova and Irakli Kosmovich Shpreigl,
   suspected of organizing mass suicide, driving to suicide,
   a failure to fulfil the work duties to dire,
   resulting in severe consequences for life and health,
   and exceeding official authority.*"
"Feel free to speak in either language.
 As always, everything you say can be used against you."
"*Grip Avdotievich Stavropolskiy, may I address you with a singular you?*"
"*As you wish.*"
"*Please summarize the most important events
  of your stay on Epsilon Indi 3 in general.*"
"*Oh... I was sent there to establish diplomatic contact with...
  let's call them lizards. They showed interest in our... nature, animals.
  They were provided samples to study.
  I think we were successful in convincing them we're safe to them,
  after which one of their representatives, I'll call him Newt...
  expressed the desire to... examine our housing,
  a possibility we've granted to him,
  after which a rather unfortunate incident--
  I think I can speak freely of it, without hurting anybody's feelings,
  as it has happened directly to me-- and...
  as he tried to study me closer, it so happened that I've perished.
  Yeah...*"
"*I'm afraid we already need a lot of clarifications at this point.*"
"*Well, you asked for a summary.*"
