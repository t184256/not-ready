Content over two things at once, Grip squeezed out of the humming kitchen.
When they took dad away, adults stopped visiting them.
And since mom skipped an expedition to stay at home for birthday,
that would've been really sad if no one came around.
But nope, guests kept pouring in, as if some floodgates had opened.
So Grip paraded to his room with a wide smile,
juggling trains of pleasant thoughts and opening lizard on the go.

Lizard came out of the blue, setting his linguistic school ablaze.
English is who-knows-how-many centuries old,
so Maria Stepanovna knows well how to teach that, but lizard?
Until yesterday there was obscenely little course material to begin with.
Dry exercises couldn't quench Grip's curiosity
about the actually interesting stuff:
what are they like, the lives of the first sapient extraterrestrials we've met?
What do they think about? What do they live and breathe?
It was weird to regurgitate phrases like
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
%"[exist] [food'], [I] [go]",
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
yet have zero idea as to what do these lizards eat,
whether they obtain food from grocery stores
and what are their shops and canteens like.
Their alien daily life aside, the very concept of scribbling signs
that people have incessantly praised him for, but no lizards would ever see,
was a strange idea all in itself.
Grip yearned for a lizard visiting Rosario one day,
once they finally agree to leave their home planet,
and at least nodding to him, like, "yeah, that is true,
this is, indeed, our language, I do understand you,
and yes, I do go grab some food once in a while".

So the "updates available" icon across the course
was a surprise present to Grip, a New Year coming early.
Just imagine --- yesterday he heard recordings of lizards speaking!
Though it turned out he doesn't quite have what it takes to replicate
those clicks and rattles, anatomically speaking.
And no one was there for him to explain their fairly straightforward
signs-to-speech mapping.
But he had almost a day to let that little bummer fade,
and today he had the second part of the treasure trove to indulge in.

At last, first stories straight out of the lizardland,
a breath of fresh air after all these soulless
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
@"[you] [sleep-not]", "[ours] [go-?] [living place']" and
@"[I] [know] [aforementioned'], [you] [know-not] [aforementioned']".
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
He swallowed them whole, one-by-one,
starting from the ideologically correct:

\newpage

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->

@... and, one by one, worked all the way through to the finishing story.
A fairly dubious one:

@"*You're not good, you're shady*,"
Grip mumbled and touched the last sign accidentally.
The dictionary pop-up has obligingly informed him,
that this sign should be translated as "proper".
All while Grip could swear it always meant "good",
at least in the first edition.

Maybe once he learns what has been refined since,
the overall meaning would become clear.
Or maybe not.
It's not like changing "good" to "proper" has clarified much.

* * *

Grip had zero doubt these texts were fairy tales,
bits of lizard wisdom told to young lizards by adult lizards
in order to teach them how to lizard.

So, when Wednesday class came around, and
excited Maria Stepanovna has announced they're supposed to write
a short story in return
("*I'll pick the best ones and send them by special comms.
@ The best ones among all planets will then be read by actual lizards!*"),
Grip knew exactly what to enrich the alien culture back with:
a fairy tale of his own people.

Cramming the older-than-space-travel action-packed source material
into the confines of a language
fundamentally unfit for expressing transitions, time,
and pretty much every single involved human concept
took hours of toiling, compromising and creativity.
But Grip persisted and ended up re-reading this:

\newpage

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->

> [aforementioned] [go] [hold] [food']. \
> [inside-in] [object-of] [purpose-of-not'] [tradition-of-not'].

And, to proactively dispel any possible doubts
about the immense didactic and entertainment value of this timeless classic
to his human culture,
Grip topped it off with a closing remark of his own:

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->

Turns out, Grip's classmates didn't quite share his dedication,
wrote about themselves first and foremost, for some reason,
and, in general, were sloppier about the assignment.
Most of his friends admitted they hadn't read the new texts yet.

Maria Stepanovna was outright puzzled by Grip's choice,
but she just stated, with great restraint, that she sees no mistakes.

* * *

Saturday was rather forgettable, and so was the first half of Sunday.
And then they came for him.

Silina Vasilyevna heard the knocking, opened the door
and instinctively froze in place.
And so did Grip, once he stumbled out of the room.
Adam Ashotovich was framed by two tall guys in black uniform.
The uniform Grip saw only once before: the morning they came for dad.
This time they weren't alone, though, but rather posed as
an ominous background for the simultaneously worried and joyous Sinitsyn.

His eyes met Grip's, and he exhaled with relief:
"*Grip Avdotievich? Stavropolskiy?*"
Grip nodded back.
"*Sinitsyn, Adam Ashotovich. We've got an important, urgent job for you.
 Can we come in?*"

It was as sudden as... him being so down to earth?
The last time Grip saw the head of the planet was the centennial
solidarity of the workers demonstration.
He was giving a speech from the steps of the administration building,
detailing Federation's achievements of the previous century,
a well-formed, captivating, exalted speech.
And there he was, awkwardly turning into the kitchen,
like a regular person who stopped by for a cup of tea,
slightly uncomfortable because he's never been here before.
Wait, they haven't left their phones.
Dad always insisted that the kitchen is for food and talking only.
Anyway, it was clearly an inappropriate moment
to bring up the unusual house rule.

Adam Ashotovich sat down, Silina took a seat to the side of him.
The chair across was, obviously, Grip's.
The pair in black weren't quite tying the room together--
a thought that probably crossed Sinitsyn's head as well,
as he immediately sent them away.
The intimidation levels went down considerably.

"*So, Grip, they say you're interested in lizards
 and know their language well.*"
"*Not so well...*"
"*Oh, cut the modesty,*" comrade Sinitsyn smiled wider.
 "*Wanna go to Epsilon Indi 3?
 But you need to depart right away.*"
"*What? Yeah, maybe,*" Grip replied, dumbfounded.
"*For how long?*" Silina inquired.
"*That's no simple question,*" Adam Ashotovich went serious.
 "*Depends.
  If it falls apart, you'll be back in three days.
  If it pans out, you'll become our ambassador.*"
That hasn't dispelled Silina's concern in the slightest.
"*At most?*" she intoned.
"*One year at most,*" assured Sinitsyn. "*What are they, animals?
 They should understand that human kids are better off
 growing among humans.
 And we sure understand you shouldn't fall behind your studies,
 so you'll be tutored while you're there, individually.*"
The kitchen went silent.

"*Uh... but why me?*"
"*Ah! Right! Because of that essay of yours*,"
  the head of the planet started squirming,
  sifted through his pockets and produced a tiny slip of paper.
  "*Read, I don't know a single lizard word, y'know.*"
"*'We don't understand'. 'That is interesting',*" Grip translated effortlessly.
  "*Is that their answer? Are you sure that means they liked it?*".
"*As I understood it, they just went 'good' or 'bad' on all the others.
  And yours was the only one to earn such a detailed review.
  Congratulations, you've managed to somehow pique their interest.*"
"*You mean, my essay was selected? Out of all the others?..
  And I'm the one to fly there?*" Grip asked, full of doubt to the brim.
"*Yes,*" Sinitsyn stated plainly.
Grip wasn't buying any of this.

"*And... what am I supposed to do there?*"
"*Establish contacts with lizards.
  Inter--, uh, inter-civilizational relationships on all levels, y'know,
  between kids as well.*"
"*That's interesting. We don't understand,*" Grip remixed.
"*Neither do I, to be honest,*" the head of the planet went down to earth again.
  "*I know next-to-nothing, just like you. My job is to send you to Arkadia.
    Secrets, intelligence services, all that stuff, so, y'know,
    you'd have to keep quiet until it gets declassified.*"
"*Intelligence services?*" Grip repeated.
"*Is it dangerous?*" Silina asked.
"*Not at all,*" Sinitsyn started reassuring her,
  "*of course it's safe, everything's by the book,
    adults would be within reach at all times,
    and he can return anytime he wants.
    Just, y'know, no synchronous communication, naturally.*"
That was no summer camp voucher,
but Silina didn't look overly worried. If anything, she looked distanced.

"*And, excuse me, how am I supposed to establish contacts,*" Grip asked,
  "*when I can read and write, but not speak?*
"*Well... they rattle and click, don't they? Of course you can't.
  And if someone can, they'll teach you.*"
In the middle of this phrase, Silina stood up and left the kitchen.

"*And what are we supposed to talk about?*"
"*I told you, I don't know!
  They'll probably explain that on Arkadia, if you agree to go.
  Or maybe later, once you're there.
  Aren't you curious to ask them all about how they live?*"
"*Of course I am. I read what they wrote, and it's not very clear.*"
"*And there you go, go ask them directly.
  Or maybe not just ask, but see for yourself.*"
"*Alone?*"
"*Of course not, why would we let you go alone?*"
"*No, I mean... Will I be the only child?*"
"*Ah. No, there will be two of you.
  You, from the Federation, and another one, from the Fist.*"
"*Fist?*"
"*Yes,*" Sinitsyn confirmed. "*It's a joint mission.*"

Grip took a pause, yet it wasn't the fists he was thinking about:
"*And they've picked me? Out of the entire Federation?*"
"*Oh, here we go again,*"
  Adam Ashotovich complained quietly.
  "*When I need a handful of people, it's 'glad to serve'.
  But every time I need just one, it's always 'why me?'...
  Yes, correct. Yours was the one selected from Rosario,
  then they picked several,
  read them to the lizards, and lizards found yours interesting.*"
"*The most interesting one? But not the best one?*"
"*Maybe sometimes it's more important to be interesting?
  Besides, if you need to pick just one, but there were several 'good',
  how to pick the best one?*"
While the argument held merit, he clearly came up with it on the spot,
revealing he didn't know much about the selection process.
"*We'll keep your little trip secret for a while--*" he resumed,
  but got interrupted by Silina's voice from another room:
"*Grip!*"

They both went to Grip's room.
Silina stood across the bed with a bag on it.
"*Oh that's nice, you've packed the bag already!*"
 Sinitsyn remarked with admiration and backed out of the room.
  "*Tref, Kornoukhov, come'ere!*".
"*Mom, are you sure?*"
"*They say Federation needs you there,*" Silina replied, crouching,
  "*And you've always said you want to know how lizards live.*"
"*That's right...*" Grip couldn't put a finger on why he's objecting.
"*I also worry about you, Grip. Just write me, and if something happens,
  go back right--*"
The pair in black have entered the room,
making Silina go quiet and hug Grip instinctively.

The men started doing something strange:
one began to unfold Grip's clothes,
while the taller one hovered above and took pictures of them.
"*Nothing but clothes here!*" the shorter one said
 without stopping for a moment. "*Grip, do you need anything else?*"
Grip pondered for a while.
"*A phone?*"
"*They'll hand you one just like yours,*" Adam Ashotovich brushed it off,
  "*Think bigger, you can order anything,
    And if you don't come up with something now ---
    worry not, you still got time to think.*"
"*Two shots*", Grip said unexpectedly.
Everybody stopped to give him prolonged looks.
"*Two cylindrical glass... small glasses.
  Not tapered, ideally, empty on the inside--*", he started gesturing.
"*Nah, I get it, I--*" Sinitsyn asked, pulling the phone out. "*What for?*"
"*That's a secret," Grip was pleased with himself. "I'll explain later.*"
"*Whatever you say, y'know,*"
  the head of the planet replied from behind the phone.
  "*You'll have these shots, no problem.*"

The guys in black packed the clothes back and headed out.
"*We'll be there,*" said the shorter one.
"*We'll wait outside,*" Sinitsyn confirmed. "*Catch up, Grip*".
"*Take the bag,*" Grip noticed the bag on the bed.
"*Nah, we're sending you through special comms*",
  Adam Ashotovich paused on his way out to shake his head.
  "*We'll print everything on the other end.*"
Silina's jolt of decisiveness was, seemingly, running out.
Grip hugged her as hard as he could, she kissed him, and he dashed out.
After all, if they say he can come back anytime, they mean it.

He almost caught up with Adam Ashotovich at the front door.
The two in black were waiting and chatting nearby.
Grip managed to
overhear "*...always were an idealist, Prostov, and you still are*",
before they suddenly started looking awfully busy and went to open a black car.
The young one rode shotgun, the older, taller one, sat at the back,
as Sinitsyn took the wheel.
Grip sat diagonally across him and inspected the interior.
He's never been inside a car, not counting the expedition rover, of course.
The car started moving.
Now Grip was staring at his oh-so-familiar town
from a totally new perspective.

"*Congrats, kiddo! Joining the military at such a young age!*"
 the closer one suddenly said without a trace of irony.
"*Uh-huh, the guy's in fifth grade and got two jobs already,
 what's not to love,*" his mate in the front replied bitterly.
"*Military?*" Grip got confused.
"*Reconnaissance of new planets, especially ones with sentient life,
 falls under intelligence services,*"
 Sinitsyn confirmed, focused on driving.
 "*And that'd be military.
   But you'll be more of a diplomat there, than an agent.*"
"*Or three jobs,*" the one at the front has interjected.
"*Oh, Kornoukhov, tell me you haven't dreamt of being an agent
  when you were a kid,*" Tref launched an attack on him.
"*I haven't,*" Kornoukhov countered.
"*Oh, come on,*" the head of the planet suddenly sided with Tref.
  "*Everybody wants to.*"
"*I didn't even know it was an option*," Kornoukhov doubled down.
"*Su-ure, now you'll be telling us you've never ever heard of Fist spies*",
 Tref sneered.
"*Of course I had, but that's spies,*" backed off Kornoukhov.
"*Oh yeah, their spies are nothing like our agents*," Tref continued.
"*OK, calm down,*" Kornoukhov cheered up unexpectedly.
 "*You got me, that was stupid.
   But they sure forgot to tell me I can enlist at 10.*"
"*And how do you envision that? A field trip?
  Where to? The Palace of Reconnaissance*?" Tref pried.
"*It occurs to me, now the four of us know how it looks like,*"
  Grip interjected.
"*You're right,*" Kornoukhov admitted from the front seat.
"*You pack some style, Grip,*" Tref praised him cryptically.

Sinitsyn kept quiet and focused on driving onto the square.
He left the car right in front of the stairs,
the stairs he'd been addressing the crowd from two years ago.
All four of them ran up the stairs, entered the hall and immediately followed
the head of the planet left, through some unremarkable door
and onto the underside of the administration.
It was dark, narrow, and in the brief half a minute Grip had to jump over
quite a few weird hoses running across.

And then they abruptly ended up in a bright room,
where they've been awaited by some bored-looking woman.
"*At last! I've been waiting-- So, you? How much do you weigh?
  Thirty kilos?*"
As soon as Grip approached her,
she looked closely and unceremoniously into his left eye.
"*Don't just stand like this, lay down over there, I'll be quick.
  Gonna finish with you and leave...*"
The woman hid behind another door.
Sinitsyn has nodded reassuringly.
Grip was still squirming, settling on a sofa,
and she already returned to inject something into his arm.
Grip immediately froze up.
She once again looked into his unblinking eye, muttering:
"*Worry not. Lights out, in a blink of an eye, here you go, yeah,
  and now you're no longer my...*"
