@... and, seemingly, for the first time on Epsilon Indi 3, Grip saw a dream.
Derevyashko, tired and distracted, smiled at Grip nervously and said:
"*Good news, Grip Avdotievich! You're immortal now.*"
His face then flew out of sight in a surreal, nauseating trajectory.
The muted voice continued:
"*Bad news are, if you're gonna make dying a weekly habit,
  all you're gonna do in between is reports.*
  Antifreeze, adrenaline, windmill."
His dream boss had a thick, charmingly ridiculous English accent:
nobody spoke like this, neither feds nor fists.
"I'm not administering a windmill!" a female voice argued.

Grip lost interest in this ominous lame dream,
and the dream has obligingly faded away
to let him contemplate what a windmill was.
Then he remembered that video.
A pre-historic device, yes --- an entire house, even,
its blades themselves being two-storey tall.
There was some monumental elegance to its radical simplicity:
when the wind blows, it spins; when there's no wind, well, not today?

Uptight and focused, Stalina Filantievna bent over to look him in the eye,
a syringe ready in her hand.
Grip closed his eyes shut just in time to stop the nightmare from developing.
He wanted it to go away, he needed to wake up a little, turn to his side,
and then he'll have another dream, a better one.
Scared, his heart pumping like crazy, he begged his body
to raise itself, turn a little and roll to the side;
yet his real body ignored his pleas, mocking him back with dizziness.
As if there was-- no.

No.
Grip opened his eyes back, his mind going crystal clear all of a sudden.
Not a trace of Stalina, but she was there, she was real,
as real as his body, his frantic heartbeat and the hard teleport floor.
No, said floor was not flowing, he was,
this new feeling wasn't grounded in any movement.
It felt as if he climbed a windmill blade,
and a gust of wind set it spinning,
but it hasn't yet moved enough to the right
to turn him upside down. Or at all. Not yet, not ever.
The body wanted to fight the spinning as if it was real though.
He'd fall and tumble, if he wasn't on the floor already.

"*You're gonna feel better soon,*" Derevyashko appeared again.
 "*Better at everything but walking, that is.*"

"*Walking?*"
Thoughts have always come to Grip's mind one by one,
but now a group of five trooped in at once:
"*Right, walk, all while I can't even move.*"
"*I'm being dragged to the right. What's there?*"
"*That was no dream.*"
"*Like a carousel, but it's only one part of it I get to experience.*"
"*What happened?*"
They now cohabited his head, all at once,
in a newfound manner that didn't lend itself
to thinking about just a single thing at once.

"*You, over there, are you alive?*" Derevyashko inquired.
"*Yes,*" Grip mouthed, realizing he can move after all.
 He just really, really doesn't want to.
"*Listen carefully, Grip. Time is precious.
  You died. Most likely, murdered.
  First thing that springs to mind: who did it?*"
"*What?*" was the only thing Grip could squeeze out.
"*I'm appointing you to investigate your murder. Who wanted you dead?*"
"*What for?*" Grip latched onto one obviously extremely important thought.
 "*If I'm immortal?*"
"*Focus. Whom do you suspect?*"
"*I don't know.*"
"*OK. Fine. At least we've tried,*" he disappeared again.
 "*Got a place here, where we, could, uh...*"

* * *

What felt like half an hour later instead of a couple of minutes,
Stalina Filantievna carefully lowered Grip onto the canteen's couch
and retreated.
Dmytro Ivanovich sat on the floor and leaned on the couch.
"*Don't dismiss killing immortals as pointless,*"
 he mentored.
 "*Could be done just to stop them from doing something...
   or sharing something.*"
"*And what was I doing?*"
"*You? Sleeping, actually.*"
Grip covered his face with his hands to suppress nervous laughter.
"*Enough. Please. Just tell me properly. When did I die. How did I die.*"
"*Preliminary conclusion: you have been poisoned.
  One day after the save point, the next night, you got sick.
  You woke up, wandered down the hallway, delirious.
  Then you got even worse, Maria tried to save you and failed,
  so we printed you anew.*"
"*What did I do the day before?*"

After shifting around, Derevyashko started reading:
"*This time we brought Newt a fish.
  A special kind that lives in warm streams--*"
"*Wait, no,*" Grip objected, moving slightly. "*I do remember that--*"
"*Writing that?*"
"*Wait, no... Doing that.*"
"*So, you are writing them the next day,*"
  Derevyashko didn't mask his slight disappointment.
"*It's late. When we come back,*"
  Grip answered in short bursts, deep in his thoughts.
 "*We set out at dawn. And then it's late night.*"
"*And now you'll have to deal with the consequences,*"
 Derevyashko stated matter-of-factly.
"*And how am I supposed to?... Deal?...*"
"*Summon every suspect one by one and question them. Look out for inconsis--*"
"*No...*" Grip interrupted him and lapsed into deep thinking.
"*No?*" Derevyashko raised an eyebrow.
"*That won't do...*" Grip put it into words carefully.
 "*I've got to work with them afterwards... Can we summon everyone at once?*"
"*Sure, you're the one in-- No,*"
  Derevyashko remembered something mid-sentence.
 "*Thalia is out.*"
"*What do you mean, 'out'?*"
"*Out there in that... meeting place of yours.*"
"*For how long? What's the time, by the way?*"
"*Almost an hour ago,*" Derevyashko consulted his shiny watch.
 "*Told me that death is death,
   but she's got a diplomatic mission to run at dawn.
   Should we bring her back?*"
Grip shook his head, a move he didn't think through in advance.

"*... No, no. Let her work.*"
"*Do you suspect her?*"
"*Thalia? No. Nonsense. Why would she kill me? And poison.
  An agent like her, you wouldn't even find me.*"
"*That may be so,*" Dmytro Ivanovich smiled.
 "*But it applies the same for everyone.*"
"*Everyone here can just stop me with force alone,*" Grip muttered.
 "*As long as they wanted to. Maria then? If it was poison.*"
"*Maria could do a much better job poisoning you.
  Got any ideas why make you suffer for half a day first?
  And go through the hassle of saving you, without saving you in the end.
  That's sadistic.*"
"*Bide time? So that Thalia goes without me?*"
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"*Good, you're combining perspectives.
  Except she could just poison you later.
  Why do it early at night?*"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

"*What is Lisa doing here?*" Grip asked after a long silence.
"*Officially? She's an astrophysicist.
  For real? I also haven't figured that out yet. Have you?*"
"*No. Do you think she's a spy as well?*"
Derevyashko let out a short laugh.
"*Certainly. Everybody is.*"
"*Stalina Filantievna?*"
"*... openly and officially.*"
"*What is she doing?*"
"*How do I put it? She's a guard. Ensures security.*"
"*Irakli Kosmovich?*"
"*Now, he's a scientist first... and a scientist second.
  Maybe he won't take any action, but he'll report to us anyway.*"

"*Why am I investigating this? You're my boss, and you're here, so--*"
"*First of all, by the codex, in cases when it is possible,
  murders in the line of duty go to the victims.*"
"*But why?*"
"*It is a good call. You can know or even just suspect something th--*"
"*I am the only one who remembers nothing from that day!... Night--*"
"*--as opposed to me, who has never ever been here.
  Also, being the only one out of suspicion--*"
"*Why?*"
"*... Go on.*"
"*I mean, could I...*" Grip began hesitantly.
 "*Could I learn something that I wanted to hide from the others...*"
"*... and it was eating you from the inside,
  until you were ready to do anything just to forget it,
  up to and including inventing a novel neurotoxin.
  And, since you're bad at pharmacology,
  the neurotoxin turned out really crappy,*"
 Derevyashko didn't take his theory seriously.
 "*Nice try, agent, but nope.
   You're the one who died, you're the one to solve it.
   And, second, I'm not me. I'm a copy, not your boss.*"
Grip squinted at him inquisitively.
"*Keep that in mind in case me and the real me
  give you contradictory orders.*"
Overwhelmed, Grip closed his eyes shut.

"*Okay-y, let's gather everyone... but Thalia.
  I'll try to make sense out of it,
  and you'll watch for their reactions and inconsistencies.*"
"*Good,*" Dmytro Ivanovich replied from behind his phone.

Stalina Filantievna came in first and assumed a position next to the door.
She looked like she pulled a rough all-nighter,
but that was nothing compared to Maria.
Maria was next level devastated, barely functioning,
fighting sleep with every blink.
Next to her, Lisa and Irakli Kosmovich looked just mildly uncomfortable.

"I don't want to talk to you individually,"
 Grip began.
 "We'll have to work together after it'll be over.
  So, let's just talk like normal people.
  What did I miss?"
The front row exchanged glances.
"I found you in the hallway after you fell," Stalina Filantievna began.
"No," Grip protested. "Before that."
"I brought you back to your bed after the scan," she restarted the story.
 "Next morning you woke up later than usual,
  walked around the base a little, went to Irakli Kosmovich--"
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"Has anybody seen me before that?"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"Maybe I had," Lisa replied. "Here, you stopped for a refill."
"With Thalia?"
"No, she was with me, designing the cage," Maria replied slowly.
 "I believe she only joined you at Irakli's."
"What were we doing there?"
"You've asked for 'proper' grapheme usage examples,
 so I've collected some for you,"
 Irakli Kosmovich replied carefully, matching Maria's speech cadence.
"Where are they?"
"I don't know," he answered after a pause. "You took them with you."
"Please bring them to me."
"The papers from your night stand?" Stalina Filantievna clarified.
"Yes. Please."

Nobody said a word until she returned.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"You had a theory that 'proper' means '*to govern*'," Irakli said nervously.
 "But I don't find it convincing."
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip studied the papers in silence.
One of the sheets was new to him, covered in Irakli Kosmovich's handwriting:

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[help] [be-proper] | [be-together] [be-proper]"

"[want-not] [be-proper-not] | [be-scheme-not] [be-proper-not]"

"[be-wise] [be-proper] [be-strong] [be-proper]
|[be-strong-not] [be-wise-not] [can] [be-proper']"

"[we] [be-proper]
|[ours] [be-proper-not] (Irakli Kosmovich's handwriting: *FYI*)"

"[can] [exist'-?] [be-think] (Grip's handwriting: *imaginable*)"
|[be-wise] [you-of] [be-proper]" (some scribbles over it)

"[nature] [be-want] [you-of]
|[aforementioned] [be-proper] [be-proper-er]"

"[brain] [be-old] [be-proper-?]
|[exist-?] [purpose'] [be-olds-of]"
"[brain] [be-old] [be-strong-not]
|[brain] [be-old] [be-wise]"
"[true] | [be-proper-?]"
"[we] [know-not] | [hold] [choice']"
"[aforementioned] [be-proper]"
|[be-want] [be-proper]"

"[we] [show-not] | [aforementioned] [be-proper]"

"[rejoice] [danger'] [be-proper-?]
|[can-not] [rejoice-not'] [be-proper-of']"

"[be-proper] | [be-danger-er]?"
"[be-danger-er] | [be-interesting-er]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

The examples were hard, but Grip didn't spend much time on the nuances.

The bottom of the page bore two extra notes:

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[?#4?] --- *break itself*?"

"[be-scheme-not-?] --- *they don't write l. th., but t. underst.*"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

Grip put the paper aside.

"Yes, I have shared these examples with him,"
 Irakli Kosmovich argued defensively, unable to withstand the silence.
 "There's no context to them, and the secrecy around the protocols
  is just outright stupid, as the dictionaries are compiled
  straight off of the same minuscule corpus."
Nobody was accusing him of anything.

"And then?" Grip asked.
"We've also briefly discussed the implications of phonetic incompatibility...
 but I don't think it's of any relevance to our current subject.
 Then you left..."
"... for the lab," Maria groaned, opening her eyes.
 "To debate my objectively best pick of the lizard to print
  and argue with Thalia about cage portability...
  And then you went back?..." she said with a great deal of doubt in her voice.
"Yeah, he then returned to study algebra," Irakli continued.
 "... Though that should hold even less relevance,"
 he concluded after a long pause.
 "And then you went to your room to write a report."
"No, he's stopped by once again... shortly afterwards," Maria recalled.
 "Thalia shooed him away."
"She what?" Grip didn't understand a key word.
"... told you we'll handle it ourselves... more or less.
 She spent most of the day in the lab 'helping' me,"
 Maria made an effort to do air quotes,
 despite trying to move as little as possible otherwise.
 "At some point around then I sent her away to collect cacti samples,
  just to get a break from her for a while."
"Collect what again?"
 Derevyashko asked in his charming accent that just never got old.
"Local flora, lizards eat'em. We've got one right behind the base."
"What for?"
"To compare them to the one Grip brought me the other day."

The story fizzled out in awkward silence.
Maria reached out for a phone,
Dmytro Ivanovich also checked his.
For a minute, she was reading something, before dismissing it with an irritated:
"What kind of freshman wrote this?"

"So! We've established you visited the lab once again,
 and we know you wrote a report,"
 Dmytro Ivanovich reminded the room.
 "And then?..."
"Guess what, one last visit to the lab."
 Maria let out a tired smile.
 "But there was nothing to discuss by then,
  so you just helped Thalia carry the cage away.
  And then they left for the dome, so, question Thalia from there on."
"Was there anything wrong with me? When I got back."
"No, you were mighty fine, pretty excited about that star for some reason,"
 Lisa replied.
 "Sorry, but I just can't remember why exactly."
"I can," Stalina Filantievna took over.
 "Newt brought you the glowing star that you gifted him a while back,
  and asked why didn't it work.
  You explained him it's not broken, it just needs charging with sunlight,
  and he decided that he'd leave it in the dome. To charge.
  Don't ask me why this is important though.
  We didn't talk for long, and you left shortly afterwards.
  Once again, in order:
  you return from the dome, bring the lizard to your room,
  come back here, tell us this story,
  visit the restroom, and go to your room to sleep."

The story stalled again, as if nobody wanted to continue.
Slightly relieved from both the dizziness and the associated mind clarity,
Grip decided to sit down,
which turned into another struggle with his own body,
but at least he could see everyone comfortably now.
Dmytro Ivanovich sat at the other end of the couch.

"And?" Grip asked.
"Stalina was the first to find you," Maria replied.
"I heard you drop in the hallway," Stalina Filantievna confirmed.
 "Looked like you got up, left your room, but you didn't get far.
  I found you lying prone just, like, ten meters down the hall?
  And, uh, you lost your mind, *Grip*.
  Absentmindedly repeated something like 'he is he',
  but when I tried to put you back on your feet and talk to you,
  you got loud and started fighting."
"Fighting is a strong word," Maria scoffed bitterly.
 "Fiercely defending from everything that moves or makes a sound...
  without bothering to sit or stand.
  Shit wasn't pretty, scared Thalia away in a split second.
  I thought you had a mental breakdown or something.
  I have to remind you once again, I'm no medic."
"And I have to warn you, *Grip*, that when you'll see the autopsy,
 the cause of your death would likely be 'spinal injury',"
 Stalina Filantievna interjected, looking Grip straight in the eyes.
 "Because hours later, when your condition deteriorated,
  I snapped your neck."
Grip tensed up and swallowed involuntarily.

"We need you to understand, Grip," Maria droned in her tired voice.
 "You seemed to get better at first, and then you suddenly got much worse.
  When we've scanned you, we found out... your neuroimmune system
  was fighting hard, so hard, it was killing you.
  And, by that time, even if we managed to stop it,
  there could've been some serious lasting damage done,
  and it was safer to just revert you."
"To kill me," Grip corrected her, looking Stalina into the eyes.
"To kill you," she nodded calmly.
"And print a healthy you from the night before,"
 Lisa concluded, slightly relieving the confrontation aftertaste.

"And you say this neurotoxin--" Derevyashko began asking something.
"I told you, it's nothing like your beloved neurotoxins,"
 Maria snapped at him.
 "Shit ain't fit for killing people. Can't even vouch it's lethal for everyone.
  What, you don't trust me? Fine. Just wait for your lab's report."
"It's running late. And I get it.
 So, this... unknown chemical.
 Without any medical terms, how does one get poisoned with it?"
"First you have to come into contact somehow."
"Just touch it?"
"Better put it inside, say, eat it. I'm not sure about this part yet."
"How long does it last?" Grip asked.
"Until... sorry?"
"How long can it lie somewhere... and still work later?"
"I don't know," Maria frowned, unprepared.
 "I know nothing about its shelf life."
"And for how long can I... carry it, before it starts killing me?"
"Same, that's, essentially, the same question.
 You can have it on your skin without knowing, and then it gets you."
"It what?"
"For all we know,
 it can have zero effect on anything besides the immune response...
 Remember how you touch something hot,
 and then stick your hand under running water?
 The threat is gone, but your body still tries to fight it.
 Forget it, it was a bad example, I mean,
 your own body's defence mechanisms
 panicked, overreacted and decided they must...
 do everything they could, even if it means killing you."
"Like an allergy?"
"No, a-- yes," Maria changed her mind mid-sentence. "Right. A brain allergy."
"Is everyone..."
"... allergic to it? Could be just a small group of people including you,
 could be everyone, could be anything in between.
 We don't know, but that one will be easy to test, just give them time."
"So, please answer this," Grip began to formulate a question.
 "We found something that can kill all of us or some of us, we don't know.
  It can be anywhere around us, it could be in my ear right now...
  and if I... turn my head wrong, I'll die again?"
"Eh, not so fast," Maria replied apathetically.
 "You've just been printed anew, it's not there in the scan.
  Where would you step into it again?"
"But if it is here, inside the station, won't we all die from it?"
The adults did not subscribe to Grip's alarmism.
"So far we had just one case... you," Maria replied hesitantly.
 "Yeah, if we all start dropping like flies, we'll have a bit of a problem.
  But it's not contagious... not a virus,"
 she reworded again, as Grip frowned.
 "Even if it can spread around, it won't multiply.
  Anyway, until we have a second case, I wouldn't worry much about that."
"And if we all get it at the same time?"
"There is a protocol for repopulating the station," Stalina Filantievna replied.
 "If that's what you're asking about."
Grip paused to think.

"What about Dan and Lee?"
"What about them?" Derevyashko turned to him.
"Could they, uh, come down here... without us knowing--"
Lisa laughed out loud, the others were amused as well.
"What?"
"If you're implying they could've come here to kill you,
 you shouldn't worry about that," Stalina Filantievna shook her head.
"You would've never asked if you heard the sound the pods make,"
 Irakli Kosmovich explained.
 "It's so loud, it could've raised the dead."
"I was printed in the orbit and brought down in one,"
 Dmytro Ivanovich chimed in.
 "It was loud indeed, and, yeah, I think we can safely dismiss this idea."

"Is it normal...?"
"I'm yet to see anything normal 'round here,"
 Derevyashko made an attempt at lightening the room up as Grip got stuck.
"What's normal, Grip?" Maria asked patiently.
"Is it typical to have a deadly allergy on something new?"
"... on a frontier planet, you mean? Uh, yes and no.
 Yes, for a newly discovered bioplanet, that wouldn't be surprising.
 But not for one we're living on for a year--
 granted, our studies on this planet are very limited,
 we haven't had a single expedition approved, and
 --but we had people go outside, like, daily, for more than a year.
 And they were fine."
"That doesn't explain how did I get it."
"Precisely."
"... But I need answers. How did I get it?"
"Beats me. You could try re-enacting everything you did yesterday:
 touching everything you encounter, licking your fingers,
 tasting all the cacti you can find,
 running outside without a suit--"
Grip didn't find it funny.
"--and not washing your hands when you come back to maximize your chances.
 Is this what you were asking about?"
"Cacti? Like, the piece I brought you yes--... some days a--?"
"Nah, can't be it. I've scanned it, remember?
 Cacti, flies, lizards, none of them contain or produce this--"
"Lizards?" Grip raised his voice, wide-eyed. "Wait, you...?"
Maria let out a deep sigh.
"We've scanned a lizard once, yes," she admitted reluctantly.
 "Caught it, froze it, scanned it, released it.
  In our defence, back then we didn't know they could be sentient."
"Could be?" Grip echoed.
"U-ugh," Maria groaned, taking a pause to focus.
 "Yes. We have no reason to believe the one we've caught is sentient.
  And the lizards never brought that incident up."

The silence was tense.
Dmytro Ivanovich embodied disapproval of all the mess happening around here,
Irakli Kosmovich looked attentive and sad; Lisa stared at a wall;
Stalina did her thing again, observing and waiting for something to happen,
like when Thalia mocked her earlier;
while Maria looked like she gave up caring about everything.

"Don't worry about your secrets," Grip told her.
 "If you don't want me to know,
 *Stalina Filantievna* can always break my neck again."
"Grip!" Derevyashko raised his voice at him.
Lisa just froze,
Irakli Kosmovich shook his head disapprovingly,
Maria looked repulsed and indignant,
and Stalina Filantievna gave him just a short resentful glance.
As if she wasn't that happy about snapping kids' necks herself.
"... I'm sorry," Grip addressed Stalina.
She didn't pay him another look.

"I don't want to return to my room," Grip said.
 "I'm afraid I can get it again."
"Should I clean it?"
 Stalina looked him in the eyes again, as if nothing happened.
"No!" Grip protested. "Can you first scan it?"
"It's large," she expressed her doubts,
 "and that chemical we're looking for is not easy to detect, is it?"
"It's anything but," Maria confirmed. "Fine only."
"I can scan selectively, here and there," Stalina suggested with hesitation.
 "Got any ideas on which places should I check?"
"No, not really, no."
"And yeah, I can find you a new room. And one for you as well."
 she nodded at Dmytro Ivanovich.

Grip squirmed in place, apparently hoping that
if the clarity has almost evaporated,
so has (not) being dragged rightwards.

"Is there a... thing to prevent it from killing me?"
"Yes," Maria replied.
 "Potent stuff-- it ain't great, but it'll get better with time.
  If only I've acted earlier, I could've shut it down
  and save you. We can do it right now, if you want to."
"But I'll--"
"--lose the immunity to all the other stuff, yes, you have it for a reason.
 The good news are, we'll receive new samples pretty much every day,
 until, like, a week later, they arrive at a perfectly safe one,
 protecting you from just this thing alone."
"So, I just need to survive for a few days,"
 Grip summed it up and scanned the room.
Maria lost a battle to a yawn.
Lisa had her head stuck firmly in the clouds.

"Lisa, you didn't talk much. What were you doing yesterday?"
She flinched and turned to Grip.
"Me, uh, I can tell you what I wasn't doing: writing my report.
 I decided to follow your advice, about the final report,
 and so far I've successfully avoided doing just that.
 I was lying here, where you are, then in my room, then came back.
 After lunch, I began to put together a table of contents,
 so I started re-reading some of my previous reports,
 found a couple of small mistakes, read some other stuff,
 and, long story short, I still haven't got to, actually, writing,
 not even today... I don't know what else to tell you,
 we haven't interacted much ye-- that day... just like most of the other days."
"Mmm, OK."

Grip decided to stand up;
Stalina stepped towards him, ready to catch him if he falls:
"Where are you going?"
"Thank you for trying to save my life," he frowned and grabbed onto the couch.
 "I don't think you wanted to kill me. I'll go talk with Thalia next."
"Are you sure? You can just wait for her," Derevyashko didn't insist though.
"No, I'm fine," Grip stated and began walking away immediately,
 mostly to back his claim with not falling down from standing still too long.
"Well, you're all free to go then," Derevyashko continued behind his back.
 "Go get some sleep," he singled out someone in a lower tone.

The body obeyed Grip just fine,
but he had to learn to ignore everything it lied to him about
and keep moving.
Fiddling with the planet suit was the hardest part of it all.
Walking, surprisingly, was the easiest one.
It was dark already, the dome featured no lights,
but Grip found it with ease.
As the inner doors slid open, he saw the cage. And Thalia running towards him.

The cage was larger than he expected.
Handles in the front and in the back, a large lid,
more perforated towards the top,
more transparent towards the bottom,
some attachments,
sand tilted towards the back... Must be really heavy--

Thalia ran up to Grip and briefly hugged him,
making him freeze for a few seconds.
Newt was catching up to them, rattling something energetically,
but they didn't listen.
Grip sat down to fight his way out of the planet suit.

"*You're alright,*" Thalia stated.
"*Yeah.*"
"*From the save point?*"
"*Yeah,*" Grip nodded, confirming he was restored.
"*OK, so,*" Thalia took that as an invitation and opened the floodgates.
 "*I woke up early, didn't wake you up that day.
   Nothing strange about the morning,
   save for Stalina handing me a ball out of nowhere.
   And what for? So that I buggered off?
   I only needed that to get away--*"
"*That was my work,*" Grip surprised her. "*Doesn't matter. Go on.*"
"*Went to Maria, explained what do I want in a cage over ice cream,*"
 Thalia went full auto again.
 "*She said that when lizards finally get around to visit us,
   we're gonna carry them in this cage,
   and she's gonna film a historical video,
   so I had to joke that lizards are sentient and must sit on our shoulders,
   that'd be even better. I don't think she suspected anything.*"

They headed towards the centre,
where a glowing star awaited them
at the glass-sand border.
Newt gave up his clattering and just followed in silence.
Thalia noticed Grip looking at him and switched subjects:
"*By the way, he did tear my suit the day before yesterday, here, on the back.*"
"*How's he doing?*"
"*He's excited... he hasn't understood a thing. Let's go in order.*"
"*Yeah, sure.*"
"*You wrote me from Irakli's,
  he said all his texts are contact group transcripts,
  so we can't read them, because we need to be a blank slate,
  and this is bullshit, because he read them all and understood nothing,
  so you don't stand a chance, and a handful of examples won't make us fall
  into the same rut--*"
  she let out another barrage, making Grip smile involuntarily.
She tried so hard to work the recently learned word "*rut*" into the sentence,
yet, at the same time,
iotated the last sound like an exemplary Fist spy she was,
laying down some thick phonetic basis for an arrest.
"*--so he did share some 'proper' usage with us,
    and you had an idea that 'proper' meant 'ruling', as in 'to rule',
    which is stupid,*" she continued. "*Even though I myself told you
    contactees must be of a high rank, it just doesn't--*"
Grip got briefly distracted to sit down
and to draw a large "[do-wait]" on the sand.
"*I saw it, cut to the chase.*"
"*Uh... And told us to make up new 'sky juice's,
  because otherwise we're not gonna get far without borrowing words,*"
  she accelerated again.
  "*Then, at the lab, you wanted a 'visually similar' lizard,
    and we wanted an accli-ma-tized one, discussed the cage,
    then studied, then came back again.
    I dropped you a hint that you should not come check up on it this often,
    but I basically lived that day at the lab, as if I was bored,
    even wrote my reports there,*"
 she started slowing down at last.
 "*Got so tired of me, she even sent me to gather cacti.
   You also left to write a report,
   then we were done printing and I went to collect sand, then you were done,
   and we carried the lizard here.
   That's also when you stopped worrying, by the way, I thought it'd be worse.*"
"*What do you mean, 'it'd be worse'?*" Grip stared at her.
"*You know, that you'll be worrying so much it'd be telling.
  And you got real calm all of a sudden.*"
"*Am I not calm all the time?*" he inquired.
"*So, when we carried the lizard here,*" Thalia evaded the question.
 "*Newt brought the glowing star, he took it underground for the day,
   and it went off, so he thought it was broken, get it?
   You explained it, and he said he'll charge it here, in the dome.
   Why here though? So that the others don't take it away from him or what?*"
Even though she slowed down, Newt gave up on listening and lay down.
Grip also didn't know why leave it here, so she continued:
"*Newt checked out the lizard,
  told us he understands why we think it's similar, but it totally isn't.
  He knows better anyway. We then agreed we're doing it, told him he must
  behave and sound like a stupid lizard, and then we'll do it.
  He started rejoicing, and here's where you've really aced it:
  you told him that if he clicks or rejoices,
  he'd be telling the adults it's him and he's here!
  That worked wonders, he wrote that it'd be very much improper of him
  and shut up for the entire day! By the way, you asked him about rejoicing,
  and he said it's for either being proper yourself, or for seeing or knowing
  somebody else is proper, and that it's not a tradition, but nature,
  but he'll be quiet. And he really was.*"
"*Not a tradition...?*"
"*But nature. Anyway, it was time to switch them.
  We didn't know where to-- ah, you two were drawing,
  so that you could ask Newt whether the dome is a sphere,
  and he said it is, because otherwise why would he use the airlock. Yes...
  Yeah, so we just left it here, because where is it gonna go,
  and Newt told us he'll help us catch it later, so, yeah,
  I put Newt in my suit behind my neck,
  because we thought that if we take the lid off it's so gonna run away,
  and it was just like 'what do you want from me, leave me alone',
  so that was a little fight, but it didn't bite through--
  wait, what about you?*"
"*What about me?*"

They went to check Grip's planet suit;
the gloves were scratched, but not punctured.
"*... yeah... We left it some water, and those grasshoppers,
  I just dumped them other there, hope that worked out...*"
Grip stopped to check out the cage.
There indeed was a distressed lizard there, ignoring them,
its head very different from Newt's.

"*We put Newt in and went straight to your room.
  There were just Stalina and Lisa staying up,
  you rambled on that glowing star for ages
  and then told us you're going to bed.
  I also followed shortly after, to my room I mean, though I was curious...*"

They walked back to the centre in silence.

"*Right, and then you got sick at night, you moaned, fought back,
  Stalina told us you kept saying "he's here"...
  But I'm not gonna take it for consent to tell them everything!
  You-- back then...*"
Grip nodded back, Thalia relaxed a bit.
"*When Stalina carried you to Maria, I checked up on Newt briefly--*"
"*And?*"
"*And he just sat there in the cage, quiet.
  I think that's also when they called Derevyashko,
  because Stalina then told us to stay in our sections
  and refrain from all communications.
  I was terrified they'll never let me carry Newt back,
  tried to come up with something...
  Then Stalina wrote that you've got worse; then --- that you died;
  then Derevyashko flew down, tired and furious,
  suspected everyone, myself included, told me I poisoned you wrong,
  then told me the poison was bad;
  no motive, no means, same as everyone else, I guess.
  I was up the wall by the time, but I really couldn't think of anything better,
  so I just wrote him, right at dawn,
  that I'm sad about you and everything, but a mission is a mission,
  we have an appointment, and I'm going no matter what.*"
"*Thank you very much,*" Grip nodded. "*For... not contriving anything else.*"
"*I, uh... He wasn't thrilled at all, but he's got nothing on me,
  and in the end he even helped me carry Newt to the airlock himself.
  And then I dragged it all the way to the dome.
  Yeah.*
Grip expected her to continue.
"*Right. Then I let Newt out, he rejoiced for a long while,
  said he understood nothing, but it was very interesting,
  that he wanted to see everything but saw almost nothing,
  that he can't see great at all, but it was still interesting,
  that we really showed him the living place we sleep in,
  that you didn't sleep, then you did, even though the sun was down,
  and then you left, then adults came in, and he was quiet,
  so that they don't recognize him...
  He also rejoiced about Derevyashko carrying him and not recognizing him--
  though this guy wouldn't recognize him even if he learned to say 'Newt'.
  He asked why I'm alone and where's the second one,
  I told him you can't come today.
  I didn't tell him you died, cause, like,
  how would I then explain that you're alive again?
  Then we chased the lizard--*"
"*We?*"
"*Yes. Thank cosmos it didn't dig down,
  otherwise I have no idea what would I do.
  And that it didn't escape in general.
  It actually just sat there, in the water's shadow,
  but I blew it, so we had to chase it all over the dome,
  Newt drove it onto the glass and to the wall and I caught it there.
  Smashed my knees though,*"
 she gestured towards her knees, with the suit visibly dirty.
Grip looked at Newt, Newt was clearly bored.
"*Wait, you said you put Newt inside your suit the first time.*"
"*Yeah, so that they don't fight each other...
  and he doesn't do anything stupid in general.*"
"*And now you're saying you're chasing the lizard together? Without the suit?*"
"*I know, it doesn't make much sense, but now I just couldn't care less.
  Besides, we--
  I already knew it ain't assaulting us as soon as we give it a chance.
  And I'm not sure I'd catch it without Newt.
  Then we all drank--*"
"*We?*"
"*Me, Newt, and the lizard.
  Tell me, do you already know what's the poison?*"
"*Not so fast. No, I don't. I mean, they still don't know where it came from.
  Let me question the last suspect first.*"
Grip turned to Newt and raised his finger invitingly.
"*A suspect?*"
"*A witness, at the very least.*"
"*I don't think he could see much...*"

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[you] [see] | [do-show] [aforementioned']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Grip wrote with little regard to the rules.
"*No light today,*" Thalia said regretfully.
"*We'll manage. Especially if he clicks.*"
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [you'] | [you] [see]" Newt wrote after a short while.
"[exist] [be-together] [I'] [I] [know]
|[exist-not] [be-together-not] [I'] [I] [know-not]"
.Grip continued the sloppiness.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Newt froze in place.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [down-in] [sun'] | [you] [sleep] [living place-in]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Grip wrote upside down towards himself,
 as if there was someone else talking to him,
 and encouraged Newt to continue
 with a slide of a finger above the sand.

"[exist] [inside-in] [I'] | [I] [see-not] [you']"
Grip didn't react, deep in his thoughts, and Newt followed up with:
"[you] [sleep-not] [go] | [I] [sleep-not] [go-not]"
Another pause, another slide of encouragement from Grip.
"[exist] [sounds'] [be-strong] | [I] [want-not] [aforementioned']"
"Pods," Thalia has stated confidently.
 "[sound] [be-first] | [sound] [be-second-?]"
"[two]" Newt replied.
"*Wait-wait-wait, I don't get it. Why two sounds?*"
"*That's fine. One with Derevyashko, and one sent up to even it out.
  So that we have two down here.*"
Grip kept waiting until Newt ran outwards and continued inwards:
"[exist-not] [you']
|[exist] [be-olds']"
Grip tapped the sand impatiently,
prompting Newt to run closer at first to see what's happening.
He then understood there won't be new writing or anything and wrapped it up:
"[exist] [living place-in] [you-of] [I']
|[exist] [living place-in] [here-in] [I']"
Grip started composing something, re-imagining and amending it on the fly:
"[exist] [living place-in] [I-of] [danger']
|[you] [know-?] [danger'] [aforementioned]"
Newt started running before replying:
"[I] [know-not] [danger']
|[exist-?] [inside-in] [danger']"
"*Could it get into the cage?*" Thalia asked, worried.
"*I don't know.*"
"*How do we make sure?*"
"*Let's scan the cage,*" Grip decided after a brief pause.
 "*If it's not there, it's not there.* [we] | [know-not]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [inside-in] | [exist-not] [danger']" Newt replied.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Thalia twiddled nervously. Grip stared at all the recent writing, lips pursed.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [can-?] [go']" Newt asked after a while.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Can he?*"
"*He had a long day,*" Grip replied, his hand already writing the same old:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [here-in] [we'] [exist] [here-in] [we']"
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [here-in] [I'] [exist] [here-in] [I']"
 Newt didn't wait for his turn, finished earlier and used the spare time to add:
 "[yous] [be-proper] | [I] [be-proper]" before running away.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*At least he liked it,*" Grip stood up with Thalia's help.
"*Now I'm really worried about the cage's, uh, protection,*"
 Thalia sighed. "*What have we learned about it?*"
"*It's not a virus, it's some other small thing that can be anywhere,
  like, on your skin, and then it gets inside, and your brain has an allergy.
  At least mine has.*"
"*And what about a cure?*"
"*Sorta, there will be one soon. The kind to take in advance.
  There is one, it's dangerous, but they'll send us something better.*"

The cage was surprisingly light, as if sand was the only heavy part of it.
Thalia offered to drag it back alone,
but Grip actually felt more stable when carrying it.
Back on the ship they brought the cage straight to the lab,
but Maria wasn't there, so they just left it inside by the entrance,
all in silence.
Thalia left for her room, Grip went to the canteen,
and took a seat across Dmytro Ivanovich.

"*And where's Maria?*"
"*Sleeping. Should we wake her up?*"
"*... no, no rush,*" Grip took long pauses to think everything through.
 "*We brought a cage, it also was in my room. We need to scan it.*"
"*I'll pass it along. What do you think?*"
"*Could it be so that lizards aren't sentient,
  but it's mushrooms in their heads that are?*"
"*Could it be so that you need to get some sleep?*"
 Derevyashko asked calmly.
 "*You... relapsing already or what?
   Leave sentient mushrooms to Maria,
   I'm asking what do you think of your murder?*"
"*Come on, nobody has a reason to kill me. Must be an accident.*"
"*Sure.
  Touched something nasty and scratched your nose, happens to the best of us.
  Have you washed your hands?*"
Grip left reluctantly.

"*OK, now let's get serious,*" Dmytro Ivanovich continued when Grip returned.
"*I am dead serious. Stupid way to kill me, plus nobody gains anything.*"
"*Thalia got some time with the lizards.*"
"*Have you printed me earlier, she wouldn't even get that.*"
"*What if you learned something--*"
"*What do I know that Thalia doesn't?*"
"*--and threatened to tell the world--*"
"*Should've then printed me back and pretended nothing happened.*"
"*OK, wow, we've got a mastermind on our hands,*"
 Derevyashko replied, masking his fascination with mockery.
 "*Let me see, you'd need just about everyone in cahoots, myself included...
   Reports-- thirty k of energy, among other things...
   OK, breathe easy, I don't know either.
   If labs back Maria's claims, it does look like an improbable accident then.
   I'm unsure about Thalia, but others don't lie.
   Omit --- yes, divulge too much --- also yes,*"
 he smiled.
 "*But they don't lie.
   Looks like I've hopped here just to write one very expensive report
   about you scratching your nose the worst way ever imaginable,
   before disincarnating.*"
Grip let out a relieved smile.

"*Speaking of which, let me vent to you a little,*" Derevyashko continued.
Grip shifted pose again, all ears.
"*That's the first time I split up...
  I always knew it's a horrible idea, that I never want to and never should,
  and then it turned out precisely like I thought,
  you know, because it is what I thought, and what I am thinking now,*"
 he scoffed bitterly.
 "*Didn't want to, never planned to. It was just a bad day.
   I'm on edge already, leading one agent through,
   then we lose connection to another one. Full alert,
   do we assemble a team or not, do we even need an extraction--
   and then I'm told you had a mental breakdown and lost your mind.
   I'm gonna be honest with you, I was dismissive at first.
   Thought you'd just come to senses or something,
   and then Aksat-- Aksat Dzhonatanovich barges in, all like:
   'you still here? drop everything, your envoy's been poisoned!'.
   So I, OK, not dropped, more like threw my phone at him:
   'what am I gonna do, tear myself in half?',
   and, wait for it, that smug poser catches it, pretends like he's checking it:
   'funny you should ask, look at all these clearances', imagine that?
   They didn't let me do anything before the scan--*"
Grip nodded with extra compassion.
"*--and now I'm here, and all those problems are suddenly no longer my problems,
  and so is my son, and my wife, and my entire little life.
  And it's not like anything changed...
  nothing has, but... the knowledge that I'm not real,
  just an empty shell with a single function left --- write a report...
  So, spetsnazcopies? Do not recommend, wholeheartedly,
  that whole concept is sick in the head.*"
"*... well, not like I'm being offered to...*"
"*You've got all your life ahead, so...*" Dmytro Ivanovich trailed off.
 "*Sorry for getting carried away, and thanks for listening me vent.*"
"*Nah, no problem. I don't mind, really.
  I'd go to bed actually, but I don't know where to.*"
"*Ah... and what are you waiting for?
  Just ask Stalina-- wait, I'm gonna ask her...*"
  he reached out for the phone.
  "*I've got the same...*"

"*Yeah, and please, don't get carried away with the immortality,*"
 he returned to the conversation.
"*No, no, I don't plan to.
  I take it, it was super unpleasant to, uh, past me--*"
"*Exactly.*"
"*--but I can't promise to not die, until I'm getting told,
  like, what exactly am I supposed to avoid!*" Grip waved his hands in the air.
"*Yeah, good enough for me.*"
"*Let's go, boys,*" Stalina spoke up from the door frame.
"*Don't worry, Grip, nobody's blaming you. We are worrying about you.
  Just do what's in your hands.*"

She led both of them beyond the teleports.
Another bland room, another huge bed.
@"*Let's sleep on it,*" Grip muttered, as he was scaling it,
then lied on his back, processing two days for one.
