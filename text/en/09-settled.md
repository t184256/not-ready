# (Not) settled
<!-- ltex: language=en-GB -->

As he was turning in his sleep, Grip opened his eyes for a moment
and squinted at a paper sign on top of the cage enhanced with duct tape.
Now he absolutely had to make out the ШШШШШ that was written on it.
The messy, incomprehensible writing resisted his feeble decoding attempts
until it dawned on him that it really was a hastily written "*SHHHHH*".
And, at this point, he was already too awake to fall back to sleep.

From up here, he found the lizard lying in the corner,
motionless; started figuring out whether it was Newt or not,
then somehow switched to worrying whether it's alive instead.

Dmytro Ivanovich peeked into the room and saw Grip lying awake.
He then brought his palms together to rest his head on them,
suggesting Grip to get more sleep.
Grip shook his head ever so slightly.
The wall concealed the bulk of the reply gesture,
leaving Grip unsure what his departing boss meant by that.
Ugh. Nothing new on the phone.
Might as well get up.

No matter how quiet Grip tried to be,
the lizard still shook from the small thud marking his contact with floor,
so he stood still for minutes to ensure it's asleep again.
Grip then moved closer to observe it, ensured it's really Newt,
of the newer variety.
And proceeded to sit across for a long with
his burgeoning thoughts never forming a single coherent idea.

Finally, he stood up, grabbed a clean suit and walked down the quiet hallways.
When he passed the canteen, for the first time ever
he found Thalia without her noticing him first.
Her hair loose and dishevelled, her attitude quiet and sombre,
she dined facing an open tube drawer,
a far cry from the usual burst of energy terrorizing the crew.
Grip waved her hello at half the usual speed as he passed by.

On his way back from the showers,
he found Derevyashko and Thalia occupying the opposing sides of the couch,
deep in their phones, not reacting much as he jumped to land between them.
Where are their manners? Agents. And what's up with the hair?

"*How did it go?*" Grip asked in a very quiet voice.
"*Eh, he didn't see much,*"
  Thalia put visible effort into switching contexts,
  "*but he understood we're copying you and demanded we copy him next.
    And we're like, 'No', and he refused to listen.*"
"*Right--*"
"*Just repeated that we don't want to.*"
"*Right, and how did you explain it?*"
"*Uh, well, I basically didn't. That's the kind of stuff you excel at, so...*"
"*Didn't Irakli Kosmovich help you?*"
"*No-- that was weird, actually. I thought he has a lot to ask Newt,
  but I got the feeling they talked just... long enough for him to check a mark,
  like, 'I got to talk with a lizard'.*"
She interrupted for a yawn.
"*Anyway, you know this feeling, when you say something, Newt says something,
  you have no idea whether you're on the same page,
  but this time there's also Irakli Kosmovich,
  watching you write as if I'm a subject of an experiment.*"
"*You?*"
"*That's what I said? Almost like Newt's writing's too good to be of interest.
  My scribbles, on the other hand...*"
"*And?*"
"*We put him in-- yeah, he complained about the light, so we dimmed it,
  and then it was my turn to get scanned, so I don't know.*"
"*Alright.*"

Grip fetched himself a tube and peeked into Thalia's phone on his way back:
"*What'chu reading?*"
He tried to focus on the text she was jumping around,
but when he could make out the words, they just didn't make much sense together.
"*Laws,*" she yawned again. "*Ours.*"
"*Huh?*"
"*She's estimating how much trouble she's getting in for closing a planet,*"
 Derevyashko elaborated for her.
 "*Don't look at me like that, they have a pile of mess for laws.*"
"*No, I mean, 'closing the planet'?*"
"*Ah, that idea from yesterday-- weren't you the one to suggest it, actually?
  To cut the comms--*"
"*You did that.*"
"*No, I mean, turn it back on and go 'sh-sh-sh, don't talk, just listen.
  This large chunk of data is Grip, then these thirty kilos are--'*"
"*Irakli Kosmovich's papers,*" Thalia interjected.
"*That's a good one,*" Derevyashko remarked after the chuckles died down.
 "*Anyway, we all escape and then go 'nuh-uh'
   and shut down the comms again for good.*"
"*Until they invent brain slugs of their own?*"
"*Until they fly another ship here and turn it back on. I guess,*"
  Thalia commented.
  "*So, like, ten-thirty years later they'll be knocking on our door anyway.
    Maybe later. But not earlier than that.*"
"*And why?*"
"*How? When there's nobody nearby.*"
Grip paused to think and forgot to eat.

"*Just in case:
  she doesn't really mean we're pull off a twenty-eight-year-long robinsonade,*"
 Derevyashko clarified.
 "*Just clone the lizards and kill ourselves.*"
"*But that ain't much. If we don't fix their procreation, how good is that?*"
"*Very,*" Thalia argued.
 "*Twenty two heads are better than eleven.
   Chances are, they'll survive until--
   forget it, they'll become immortal right away.*"
"*Right.*"
"*We should store it somewhere safe...
  Yeah, and... I don't think Maria has the confidence to fix them.
  And we can't drag more people into it.*"
"*Why not-- No, I know that, but--
  Can we then print those who have already been here?*"
"*We're not printing people without their consent, Grip,*"
  Derevyashko made it clear it's not negotiable.
"*Yeah,*" Thalia nodded. "*I hope Maria won't crumble under the pressure.
  We're already demanding her to scan Newt without killing him,
  single-handedly--*"
"*You mean, four-handedly? Or should it be two-headedly?*"
"*Yeah, that'll drive her nuts quicker...*"

"*I knew there's a reason why they left her behind,*"
 Dmytro Ivanovich nodded to Grip as if they shared a secret.
"*Who, Lisa?*"
"*Yes. 'There are no randos here, in deep space',*" he quoted the classics.
Grip immediately put his hands together
as if he was in class, eager to give an answer.
But after the nod of curiosity from Derevyashko,
Grip named neither the book nor the movie,
but rather curled his right hand in to point himself in the chest,
highlighting the closest available exception to the rule.
Dmytro Ivanovich was lightly amused, but did not elaborate a single bit.
He looked eerily content with his mind roaming elsewhere
until actively interacted with.

"*What are we going to tell the lizards?*" Thalia asked.
"*The truth,*" Grip shrugged.
"*The truth?*" her eyes widened, she set the phone aside.
 "*Better start preparing, because the truth is a bit messy. Let's see,
   the last time we've already revealed we know your secret,
   even though I don't know why make it a secret--*"
"*--cause they didn't make a secret out of it,
  they just thought we're the same. It wasn't secret!
  When he climbed into my ear to say hello, he kinda didn't expect--*
"*--what properness has Newt broken?*"
"*Duh, made us fewer.*"
"*That came up later, when the Second climbed you. Why be angry before that?
  Trying to enter what's already occupied?*" she giggled.
"*Well, that could be one theory.*"
"*Anyway, so now we fly away. But we don't fly--*"
"*--fly, but it's not us, so--*"
"*--mean 'not us', it's us, just different us.
  And now we want your brains, all of them.*"
"*What for?*"
"*Just in case you all die of something, but, whatever.
  In totally unrelated news, please line up in front of that scary machine
  of ours, yes, the one that's the reason
  you don't talk to the previous contact group any more.
  We actually think it's a horrible idea, so horrible,
  that we had a bit of a falling out with the ours,
  leading to all of us leave and some of us stay, so--*"
"*OK, OK, I got it. Better not bring that up at all.
  We want to help, so we want to copy you.*"
"*We just don't, for some reason,*"
  she leaned back, satisfied, and picked up the phone again.

"*Look, I've been wondering,*"
 Grip addressed Thalia after a while.
 "*How do your secrets work?
   What can you tell and what...*"
"*... uh, just like yours?*" his partner frowned.
 "*We decide what's secret and what's not at home, after the mission.*"
Derevyashko raised an eyebrow at her "*at home*", but refrained from commenting.
"*And before you return?...*"
"*They control all the comms anyway?*" she returned to her reading.

"*Glad you're here as a spy, huh?*" Derevyashko asked immediately.
Grip underwent several facial expression changes before
realizing the question targeted Thalia.
Dmytro Ivanovich noticed that and clarified:
"*Were you two here as diplomats,
  you'd have your tails chewed off clean by now.*"
"*Why? We've preserved the relationship.*"
"*Preserved? You're about to sever it!*" he was amused.
 "*Should I really detail into all you did wrong-- sorry, undiplomatic?*"
"*Yeah, especially given our task--
  and that the official diplomats were recalled already,*"
 Grip took it personally.
"*That was contactees, that's different.
  Diplomats won't even have your goals from the start,
  they cannot do as much as sneeze
  in a direction ever so slightly misaligned with the line of the party.*"
"*Yeah, I just wonder how...
  Like, all this human stupidity we'd be using against them,
  they don't even know the rules of it.*"
"*Like what? Do you know the rules of it?*"
"*Oh, it's gonna be all those subtleties and vacuous rituals, won't it?
  I don't know, I've got sweets, a diplomat wants them,
  and then he'll sob, grimace and never ask?*"
"*I can't make up my mind on whether you don't know a thing about our diplomacy,
  or you know it all too well,*" Dmytro Ivanovich grinned.
"*And now lizards, maybe their kids shouldn't eat sweets,
  or maybe they build houses out of them, it's gonna be even worse.
  And, sure, they'll never understand our sobs and grimaces!
  How would we even explain our diplomacy to them?*"
"*Ah, that's when you'd get recalled. 'Explaining them', unbelievable.
  Our diplomacy is all about extracting profit.*"
"*Look, aren't we acing it? We're here for three days,
  and the lizard begs us to let it climb into a teleport?*"
"*... or you'd be recalled on the actual day three, your corpse still warm.*"
"*One step to the right, one step to the left...*" Thalia mumbled.
"*Sure, when you try to take sweets by force--*"
"*No, you don't get it,*" she looked him in the eyes.
 "*Diplomats are so tense, you won't even think of doing something off-script.*"
"*Yeah, I wouldn't make a good diplomat--*"
"*It's not like anybody offers you to,*" Derevyashko shrugged.
 "*She could, though, if she wanted, she knows it from within.*"
"*--not like I made a good spy anyway,*" Grip concluded.
"*So, everybody is good at their own domain.
  Except those dangerously good at theirs,*"
 his boss blurted ominously.

"*So, my dear colleague, how does your media work?... Like, journalists--*"
"*--What? Better than yours,*" she snickered. "*That's for sure.*"
"*What are you up to?*" Derevyashko asked in his usual curious tone.
"*Nothing yet, I'm just asking... Ever wrote any articles?*"
"*Uh, no?*"
"*OK, you sure read some?*"
"*I, uh, I'm not--*"
"*Come on. Yes, she sure had,*" Derevyashko interrupted her.
 "*Don't tell me you didn't read a single one on the--*"
"*OK, let's say I've... addressed people through media before.*"
"*Huh?*" Grip marvelled at her constantly changing face expression.

"*Wait,*" she finally settled on disbelief.
 "*Don't tell me you never read my file.*"
"*Where would I get one, the comms are--*"
"*--you had three days to--*"
"*--sure Stalina wouldn't mind sharing,*" Derevyashko chimed in.
"*Unbelievable... OK, it's official,*" she patted him on the shoulder,
 "*I hereby declare you a valenok. Through and thorough, no take backs.*"
She slumped back, looking at Grip as if she saw him for the first time:
"*I thought you didn't trust me for good reasons, and you...*"

"*OK, I really didn't read your file, and I don't really want to.
  Just tell me what would I find there? Anyway?*"
"*Well, she's an activist,*" Dmytro Ivanovich opened the can of worms.
"*... how do you manage?*"
 Grip subscribed to rather peculiar Fed ideas on what constitutes activism.
 "*Wait, you're a spy, how can you--*"
"*Everybody knows who I am since he caught me.*"
"*Right, and what are you up to? With that activism?*"
It took seconds of hard thinking for Thalia to cram her life's work
into one slogan:
"*Power to the kids.*"
"*What?... And... after all the sweets are captured, what's your plan?*"
"*I mean, I'll be too old for this, but maybe I can raise the right kids...*"
"*--kids, if you didn't notice-- Right? What do--*"
"*Like me. Smart, caring about the future, long-term.
  Those who'd protect the lizards even though nobody asked--
  even if they'll get in trouble for it.*"
"*--or bomb factories--*"
 Derevyashko couldn't resist adding fuel to the discussion.
"*--sure, b-- What factories?... Ones producing wrong kids?*"
Grip's joke didn't fly.
"*I think it was a uranium refinery,*" Derevyashko felt compelled to answer.
 "*I mean, that's none of my business; as long as it's their refineries...*"
Grip stopped to take a deep breath.
Thalia hid behind her phone, making weird sliding movements across it.
"*To answer your original question, I think she's handling both jobs just fine.
  Mind that the life of an open agent is rather boring, so--*"
"*Boring?!*" Grip lashed out. "*I've been playing soccer on Rosario
  after school, just, what, last Friday? Without a care--*"
"*--could play some here, actually,--*"
  Thalia's attention clung to the tamest part of his outburst.
"*--Boring, huh? Not a single refinery bombed, and I'm almost eleven.*"
"*You got your whole life ahead of you,*"
  Derevyashko suppressed a yawn.

"*OK, maybe just one question. How are you a spy, if your dad is a defector?*"
"*Why is-- how are you a spy, if your dad is a dissident?*"
  she shrugged at him. "*How does that matter?*"
"*Hey, he's not even convicted yet,*"
 Dmytro Ivanovich remarked from the depths of spacing out.
Grip hid his surprise and tensed up, counting months in his head.
"*Oh lemme guess, and now he'll never be,*" Thalia mocked him.
 "*All hail the best court in the world.*"
"*Second to yours, really,*" Derevyashko sneered.
 "*What are you hoping to find there anyway?
   We all know they'll find you guilty if they want to.*"
"*Me? I'm drawing, actually.*"
She turned the screen towards him, adorned by, uh...

"*What is it? Are these... eyes?*" Grip squinted at the picture.
"*Correct!*" She was so proud of herself. "*I think they'll be on stalks.*"
"*... I-- I don't get it.*"
"*How about now?*"
Thalia added spokes to the wheels
and threw in three extra lines going off-screen.
"*I'm sorry--*"
"*It's Newt! The real--*"
"*--ahh! Haha, OK, why not, but why-- why the wheels?*"
The screen shook too hard from their laughter
to search the picture for further clues.
"*Weren't you worried about him killing all of us?
  Well, he's got a lot of ground to cover in one night!*"

* * *

"*What would they do to me?*"
"*You? Nothing, I suppose,*" Irakli Kosmovich did not dismiss his concerns,
 but didn't exactly ascribe to them either.
 "*What could they do to a kid? That'd be a new low.*"
"*Can't be what they wanted me to do.
  Can't be that they won't try to punish me.*"
"*You will be punished, in a way.*"
"*What do you mean?*"
"*Let's just say...
  you're well positioned to make friends with very influential people.
  But only if you were to give them what they want to.
  Or give them something and convince them it's what they always wanted.*"
"*So what, what gives?*"
"*Right. Education is an obvious one, given your age. And the most useful one.
  Every Fed university would've considered it an honour to admit you.
  Who knows, maybe you could even find your way into a Fist one.*"
"*And if I don't?*"
"*No, it's not like they'll ban you or anything.
  They're petty, but not that petty.
  You'll just have to make do by yourself. Same as everyone else.*"
"*Doesn't sound that bad.*"
"*Well, yes and no, chap. Yes and no.*"
"*... Would you?... er, miss it? This place.*"
"*Rather not, to be honest.
  I don't care much where to work from,
  My wife has passed away, all my kids have families of their own, so...
  But one thing I sure won't miss is this insane gravity.*"

* * *

As Grip was heading down the hallway, he heard Stalina's faraway voice,
asking quietly, but legibly:
"Going recruiting, eh?".
He froze in his tracks, turned all ears,
but couldn't make a thing out of Thalia's answer:
"???o??? ???u???".
Grip then slowly turned back and had relief wash over him
when all he saw was an empty hallway,
and there was no one to justify his pantomime to.

* * *

Thalia had to run almost all the way to the dome to retrieve the ball
after that mighty kick of hers.
Grip lowered himself onto the sand, gasping for oxygen, drenching in sweat.
Outplaying Thalia wasn't fun.
He might've trained all his life to play in this gravity,
but not the climate. And not the suits.
The very idea of playing soccer with just the two of them,
on sand, under scorching sunlight,
was starting to feel rather stupid in hindsight.

Thalia returned, her enthusiasm faltering as well,
so she unzipped the hood and looked the same direction.

"*What's up?*"
"*Is that another cactus?*"
"*What else? Could it be?*"
"*Has it always been there?*"
"*Uh, yeah? It's just far-- You might've never stood on this side o--*"
"*--likely. Wanna check it out?*"
"*Uh. Whatever.*"

Shortly after they've passed the solar panel array.
Thalia gave up and picked up the ball.
Yet the cactus looked only a hair taller than before.

* * *

"*I have to tell you one important thing.
  If your disagreement with the Federation reaches critical levels,
  the Fist would be happy to see you. Any embassy, anytime.*"
Grip never saw a single embassy in his life.
To think of it, he was pretty confident Rosario had none.
"*... don't get me wrong, you're unmatched with lizards,
  but I just don't think you're cut out for this line of work.
  I'd be happy to see you join our movement though.*"
"*This activism thing?...*"
"*Yeah, I think you'd fit in...*" she trailed off. "*I wish Lora was here.*"
"*Lora?*"
"*You don't know her; she's, like, just loves those dilemmas and stuff.
  She'd know what to do in an instant, and then be so... ardent about it...
  And I'm more of an action girl, you know.*"
"*Huh. I thought you must be the leader o--*"
"*No-no-no, heh. I'm not,*" she began to zip up.
 "*There aren't that many of us anyway.*"

* * *

"*At last,*" she exhaled when they finally reached the cactus.
Grip fumbled with his hood, so he missed this remark of hers.
"*Do you think it'd be taller than ours,*" she continued,
 "*if it weren't chewed up so mer--*"
"*Quiet!*"
While tugging on the zip,
Grip turned his head an odd angle and noticed some sand movement to the side.
He stopped to examine it intently,
and the sand dweller lost the staring contest to dig itself even deeper.
"*They're watching us. We should--*"
"*--about to leave anyway.*"
They turned back with exaggerated smoothness and began retracing their steps.

* * *

"*So, you're worried about the court?*"
"*Co-- A tribunal, you mean. I'll be tried separately.*"
"*Yes, the trial.*"
"*Derevyashko's right,*" she admitted reluctantly.
 "*It's entirely up to them. But I can't imagine just... uh... And you?*"
"*Not really,*" Grip shrugged.
"*Good. Good.*"

* * *

"*Got a minute?*"
"*Sure, sure.*"
Grip decided it must be extremely important
if Irakli Kosmovich stopped him in a hallway like this.
"*So, I've looked up the oath, and it explicitly states--*"
"*The what?*"
"*The military oath.
  The pledge you gave to defend the Federation from-- gimme a second.*"
Grip decided against telling him he was never under any oath to begin with.
"*So, here, 'solemnly swear, la-la-la...
  and faithfully defend the Federation from any threat, external or otherwise'.
  Meaning you could own it up and stick to the 'oh, that thing that killed me?
  No, sorry, left it back there.
  I can't let it roam the brains of the peaceful Fe--*'"
"*Right, right,*" Grip nodded vigorously. "*Makes sense.*"
"*--lost my life to learn it poses a threat to humanity,
  oh, and I was then told it's as deadly for all of us, as--*"
"*--so that's why I've done all I could
  to prevent it from spreading to other planets from this disastrous...*"
"*Precisely. All 'without ill will'. I'm not a lawyer, but, just a thought.*"
"*That's interesting, that could come handy.
  I'll keep that in mind. Anything else--
  Thank you then, thank you! Sorry, I'm in a dire need of a shower right now.*"

* * *

"I've gathered y'all here today--" Derevyashko began loudly.
"--whoa, whoa," Maria assumed a comfier position.
 "Calm down. Who do you think you are?"
"Look, I've got nothing to do and no skin in the game.
 I hope you've now processed the events of yesterday,
 you've calmed down,
 and we could finally make a decision.
 First, I would like all of you to tell what you think about the situation.
 One by one. Lisa."

"I, uh," Lisa was as prepared to give speeches as everyone else in the room.
 "Look, I... I know I've been a mess recently,
  and none of it actually made any sense,
  but, weirdly enough, now when I've met Dima... it kinda snapped into place.
  I stayed here for a reason, and found my purpose-- to help Maria
  --so completing this is... what I'm gonna do? And the other me could finally
  return, finish my studies, I hope, live a real life.
  And if I need to split to reconnect-- to become whole again..."
She rambled on and on, and Grip tried to find consolence
in that the others were just as uncomfortable as he was.
He then remembered what does it remind him of:
that time when Mitya pulled Farida's braids so hard she burst into tears,
and Violetta Petrovna made him explain to the class
why did he think that was a good idea.
Watching him squirm and mumble something incoherent
was basically collective punishment in itself,
leaving them all to wonder what did they do wrong for them to endure it.
"... and I don't see how it's less important than I am, so yes. I agree,"
 she finished her speech without ever specifying what does she agree with.

"Thank you," was everything "Dima" could muster.
They've processed it for a while in silence,
making it her turn to squirm and blush.

"Alright, who's next?" Irakli Kosmovich broke the silence.
"Sure, go ahead,"
 Dmytro Ivanovich came back to his senses and turned towards him.
"I'll be brief... Grip is right. And we also cannot leave the lizards like this.
 Do what you must, but I don't want that on my conscience. Let me leave first.
 And then raise a generation of kids who'd make me even more proud
 than the two of you. That's it."
"We'll see. Maria?"

"Grip is wrong, like, fundamentally. You all just don't get it.
 Newt's scan is not a magic wand of mind control.
 It might be the key to what you'd call sentience itself.
 For science, it's a treasure trove of everything,
 good and bad if you're stuck with such a simplistic world-view,
 but nature, nature knows no good or bad.
 They live in lizards, yet none of you condemns that somehow?
 I bet you'd be appalled by mind-controlling humans, elephants or growlicks,
 but you draw the line at lizards?
 Your shaky moral-- This just isn't how it works.
 You don't get to pick-- you don't get to ban knowledge itself.
 You don't get to stop the march of progress.
 And delaying it is pointless as well.
 Make controlling people a crime if you can,
 but keep your hands away from studying it.
 And even if your crazy plan worked,
 all you'd accomplish was sabotaging zoology, neurochemistry. Everything."
"And somebody," Lisa interjected quietly. "Somebody out there will die
 because of something we didn't learn today?"
"Well put. Thank you.
 I'd just stress this isn't a narrow setback.
 It would impact the entire humanity."
"Alright, I think you've made your point. Stalina?"

"Grip is wrong," the door frame dweller made several steps towards the group.
 "But not because the march of progress or mysterious ways of science ---
  it's just not up for him to decide, simple as that."
"And who do you think gets to decide?" Thalia erupted.
 "DFA, DoX? KGB? A joint ethics committee?"
"Please await your turn," Derevyashko insisted quietly.
"Excellent question. I don't know," Stalina stated, unfazed.
 "But I know it's not you. Not him. Not me.
  So, what we must do now is to turn on the comms
  and let the right people handle it.
  If it is a job for an ethics committee, they should sit down and decide.
  Listen, I'm not going to stop you. I can even volunteer to be the last one.
  But I need you to know you're making a huge mistake."
"Loud and clear. Are you done? Thalia."
"And you know what their decision will be!"
"I have my suspicions, yes," Stalina smirked.
"The nerve..." Thalia shook her head.
 "OK, you know my stance. Grip's right. Let's do it."
"Uh, alright. Grip."

"Ahem. So, first of all. Those agreeing with me, those disagreeing with me.
 Could you first kindly-- articulate it, is that a word in English?"
"It sure is," Irakli Kosmovich nodded.
 "And that's likely my fault, overdoing the brevity.
  What I meant by agreeing with you,
  was not letting the scan leave this planet."
"Same," Thalia chimed in.
"Second, it's not my plan. It's not even a plan if it doesn't have steps.
 What are those steps? What are we discussing?"
"Not like we have many options," Lisa nodded.
 "We send ourselves back, but leave copies-- originals... behind.
  With the comms shut down, they scan Newt. Save the lizards.
  What do you-- what would you let us do differently?"
"You don't like the suicide part. Can it be done without suicide?"
"How?"
"I don't know, I'm just-- say, send ourselves back, but it's our old scans."
"And?" the crew struggled to comprehend his idea.
"And here we just live, until we die, so, no suicide."
"Please, just kill me right away," Maria exhaled.
"Our inevitable insanity aside", Irakli Kosmovich shook his head,
 "I'm in awe at the deviousness of sending back the scans they already have."
"Yeah, that'd be a top-notch twist," Derevyashko nodded.
 "For a mystery psychodrama. 'Who killed Grip?' --- 'What??' ---
  'Why did you close the planet?' --- 'We did what???'
  I can almost see the headlines: 'Mystery of the abandoned planet'."
"'Lizard planet'," Thalia corrected.

"And you?" Maria addressed Dmytro. "Where's your monologue?"
"I'm nobody. I'm not even here," he made silly passes with his hands.
"Stop it.
 You're clearly dissociate, and stupid jokes are not the help you need
 right now," she pursed her lips.

"OK, if you don't want a better plan, we can do the one we have,"
 Grip leaned back, disappointed and offended.
 "I'm OK with changes. We just must not scan until we close the planet."
"I'm terribly sorry, but how does one 'close a planet'?"
 Lisa made a circular gesture.
"They 'open' them in Russian, so, 'undiscover' is what he meant,"
 Thalia was quick to explain.
"One cannot undiscover anything," Maria groaned.
 "They know where it is. They'll be here again in fifteen years."
"Then we'll have fifteen years to figure it out," Thalia insisted.
"Yes. What she said," Grip nodded. "We're not ready."

"Close the planet," Irakli Kosmovich chuckled. "Farah's gonna eat you alive."
"Our Farah?" Dmytro Ivanovich gawked at him. "Nah, she'll come up wi--"
"No, their Farah," Thalia 'clarified'. "A linguist. You know what I don't hear?"
"OK, I'll bite," Derevyashko leaned towards her.
 "What is it that you don't hear?"
"Objections! Na-na-na-na-na--" she raised her palms towards Maria and Stalina.
 "I heard you. Progress. Mandates. Huge mistake. I can live with that.
  But then you say you'll do it! That's-- all I'm asking for!"

"And you?" Maria played what she thought was an ace up her sleeve.
"Me? What about me?" Grip squirmed.
"Will you kill yourself for this plan of yours?"
"Yes," Grip answered without a thought in the world and then frowned a little.
Something was off about the word that just rolled off his tongue.
Back in a dark corner of his mind,
an everlasting imprint of a different Maria --- Maria Stepanovna ---
shook her head in disapproval.
"Yes, I will," he corrected himself to not omit the auxiliary.

* * *

"Why are you here?" the kids barged into Maria's room.
She paused some old show on her phone and gave them a tired look.
"What do you want from me? I'm taking a day off."
"Shouldn't you rather be in the lab?"
"What for? Would you let me scan him?"
"No--"
"--but shouldn't you be preparing--"
"How?"
"Do you wanna come with us and see him leave the body?"
 Grip played his strongest card, and that left Maria hesitate for a second.
"Nah."
"Really?!"
"What would you want me to see without a scanner? The outer colour?"
"What if it's transparent?"
"I need a good look at its brains.
 Call me when you're done tying my hands."

"Right. Another thing then. Can you print me freeze, but for the other lizard?"
 Grip asked.
"OK? That I can print without getting up,"
 she made a quick series of taps and brought the show back.
"Thank you very much! And now, while it's printing,
 could you just answer some questions?"
"Fi-ine, but keep it quick. What do you want to know?"
"The biggest problem is how to freeze the brain--"
"No, the biggest problem is kickstarting it back."
"Wha-- Can you explain it, but super simple?"
"Sure," she sighed.
 "Cause all of that is simple... We don't know how to restart any brain."
"But, but..." Thalia uttered. "What about us? We--"
"We know human brain does start up and looks mostly fine.
 But don't get an idea that's because we shut it down cleanly
 and know the secret initialization sequence.
 In fact, we're confident there is none.
 We know we don't shut it down right,
 it just happens to work almost every time, so we're doing it anyway."
"Almost."
"That's why you shouldn't save or hop often.
 It's like you take a hit to your entire brain at once,
 you just don't get to remember how--"
"Can't be..." Thalia refused to believe her.
 "We hop all the time. And we're all fine."
"--and it's kinda fine, but I can't just assume it'd work for Newt."
"I... see," Grip kept Thalia away from the conversation.
 "And all the other animals, do their brains start fine?"
"Copied as is, they manifest symptoms of distress--
 for humans we know how to make it go smoother
 --otherwise... hard to tell.
 When everything's done right, they do function,
 and they do get to keep at least some memory.
 We don't know.
 We can't just ask them if they remember everything.
 Or people, for that matter..."
"Thank you very much. It's been-- Now I see why you--"
"Yes, yes. Could you please leave me alone now?"

* * *

"You again?"
"What would happen if it-- a lizard falls from... this high?"
"What do you think will happen? It will get hurt!"
"Ugh!" Grip was disappointed, but resolved. "OK!..."

* * *

"*Hold it tigh-- ugh! I will never hit the vein if you keep doing this!*"

Grip dashed into the room and pressed the hand holding the shocked,
still squirming lizard against the cage.
"*Watch this!*"
He had Newt's undivided attention indeed.
Grip then raised his arm and dropped the lizard onto the bed with a quiet thump.
Once it stopped moving,
he grabbed it again and demonstrated its twisted immobilized body
to both Newt and wide-eyed Thalia.
Newt instinctively ducked and made a step back with a slight turn.
"*See? That's what gonna happen if you fall!*"
Grip put the lizard back to its jar.
"Dude..." Thalia shook her head in awe.
"[go] [down'] [be-danger]
|[you] [go-?] [down']"
 Grip scribbled on the paper and pressed it against the glass.
"[I] [go-not] [down']
|[do-exist-not] [be-less-er] [I']"
 was Newt's immediate answer.
"No! I don't want to kill you!" Grip snapped.
"But what did you expect?" Thalia groaned with a sob.
 "You can't just barge in and threaten to kill his... body?
  Absolutely unprovoked--"
"*That's not what I meant!*" Grip shook his arms.
"Wooo..." Thalia exhaled loudly.
 "*Look, if there were rules for explaining such basic things
   to the counterparty who was first exiled, and then you abducted it,
   I'd love to help,*"
 she kept giggling. How very unprofessional of her.
 "*But look at the bright side of things, OK?
   He might've misunderstood you, but
   I'm sure he's not gonna jump down any ceilings after this...
   highly accessible demonstration of yours.*"
"*Fine then,*" Grip opened the lid and bent over to extract poor Newt.
"*What'chu doing?!*"
"*Touring the base, of course!
  Or he just won't stop badgering us about objects!*"
He left the room with Newt on his right shoulder,
and Thalia following him in lockstep, her left arm ready to catch the lizard.

* * *

"*And one more thing.*"
"*Yes?*"
"*Goodbye. I can't take it any more, I'm gonna leave while you're out.*"
"*... OK. When she called you a *dissociate*--*"
"*I always knew I'm not fit for this...
  Yes. Now I've got proof I never needed.*"
"*You did what you needed to do. Solved my murder.*"
"*Right. If there's anything else I can help with, or you're just bored,
  don't you dare print me,*"
 Dmytro put on a thin-lipped smile.
 "*Sort it out yourself somehow.*"

* * *

"This is getting out of hand," Thalia declared.
Two large lizards awaited them at the centre.
As soon as the kids sat down, all three lizards started rattling.
Thalia closed her eyes, as if that let her make anything out of this cacophony.
Grip could single out Newt with ease
--- he clicked right next to his ear, ---
but the click decoder inside his sleepy head has stalled and went up in flames.
"[do-wait]" he wrote on the sand in front of him,
 and one of the lizards even reacted.
It went quiet, walked onto to the glyph, inspected it from different angles
and demonstratively wiped it with a swipe of its tail.

A minute later, the rattling stopped as abruptly as it started.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[yous] [can] [exist'] [be-two] [be-new']
|[yous] [want-not-?] [exist'] [be-two] [be-new']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 one of them asked after a silent staredown with Newt on Grip's shoulder.
"[I] | [want]" Grip wrote as a sidenote, wiped a large patch of sand
and covered it with a detailed answer:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [be-one] [be-new']
|[exist] [up-in] [sun']
|[exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist] [up-in] [sun']
|[exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist] [up-in] [sun']
|[exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist] [be-two] [be-new']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
One lizard stared at him intently,
while the second (Second?) one replied:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist-not] [be-two] [be-new'] [do-exist] [be-two] [be-new']
|[yous] [do-go-not] [here'] [yous] [do-go] [here']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Two clicks, and they both ran away towards their airlock.
"*Fair,*" Grip stated, taking another prolonged glance at their conversation.

* * *

"*That's a bit awkward*," Stalina awaited them at the ship.
"*They just don't want to talk to us until we bring them two Newts.*"
"*I mean, Dmytro is still here. You'd better not run into him.*"
"*... and? What do you propose, to wait it out here?*"
 Grip refrained from rubbing his eyes with the hand he held Newt with.
 "*I'm heading straight to bed anyway.*"

* * *

"*Here you go,*"
 he tried to placed Newt back into the cage.
Newt didn't plan to part with his hand and kept clicking in a funky rhythm.
Grip's click decoding hasn't recovered, so he tried another strategy.
"No," he said, holding Newt as if he was a microphone. "Wait."
He then put him onto the sand and texted Thalia: "He wants something again."

"[you] [want] [...'-?]" he wrote and pointed on the sand.
"[do-show] | [objects]"
Grip let out a groan of frustration.

"*OK, what else does he want?*" Thalia ran in and bent over the cage to read.
"*He's at it again. Look, sorry, I don't care any more, I'm going to sleep,*"
 Grip closed the lid, a gesture Newt didn't appreciate.
 "*I've been awake since--*"
"*Seriously? Are you dumping him on me?
  What am I supposed to do? He's not gonna sleep--*
"*I don't know what else does he want from me, OK? Just ignore him...*"
Grip climbed onto the bed.
"*... We've showed him everything, even the pods. Even the showers.
  I'm out of ideas.
  Just leave him here, throw in some flies, maybe, and go get some sleep,*"
 he suggested and closed his eyes.
He briefly woke up again when Thalia and Stalina carried the cage away,
but just closed his eyes and ignored it.

* * *

At first, he couldn't fathom what is he looking at.
And, once he figured it out, he couldn't contain his laughter.
The cage was back, and so was Newt. And the glowing thing was a phone.
Propped up against a tiny sandhill,
it featured colourful shapes that the lizard popped with his nose.
Once Grip started his "rejoicing",
Newt decided to pretend the phone has nothing to do with him
and laid down facing the other way,
as the newly appearing shapes covered the entire screen.
A manoeuvre that didn't help Grip's receding composure in the slightest.

* * *

"*Where are you?*"
Oh, a "please call back" from Dan?
What could he possibly want? Grip basically forgot Dan and Lee existed.
He turned into an unused room.
"Hi, colleague!"
"Uh? Morning, colleague."
"I'm gonna tell you first, I'm gonna miss this planet.
 Best assignment I've ever had, and that was before you two arrived.
 Hope we'll cross paths again someday.
"Uh, OK, thank you."
"Now, there's this 'closing the planet' idea floating around,
 and seems like none of you understand how it actually works.
 Subliminals aside,
 there are bulk transfers and then there's a control channel to orchestrate'em.
 You'll need it anyway to flush us out.
 It's a tried and true signalling protocol, my point is,
 that one's fully manual and limited to 160 symbols--
 even fewer if you use those letters of yours with wider codepoints --so--"
"--Dan--"
"--that scan you're so--"
"--Dan."
"What?"
"I'm sorry, I don't even understand what you say."
"I was about to tell you, I can give you direct access to--"
"Why are you telling me this? I'm leaving."
"Man... I'm talking to the you who stays! I'm leaving now--"
"Can you give this... access to Thalia instead?"
"OK, wow."
On the other end of the line,
Dan took a few second to compose himself,
and then proceeded with admiration in his voice:
"If you say so-- I mean, I heard you two trust each other, but..."
"I trust her. Just give it to her."
"I just did, to both of you.
 So, alrighty then! It's been a pleasure, colleague. Dan's out."
OK, but where is she?

* * *

On his way to the canteen, he overtook Stalina and Irakli at first,
but then stuck with them to listen:
"*--it down for me? You found some archaic unused cases?*"
"*Sorry, it's not cases.
  There's a good reason I keep calling them 'declension systems'.*"
"*And they...*"
"*Used to have at least two that later merged-- morning, Grip.*"
"*Morning.*"
"*And you've spent all night talking about... case systems?*"
"*No, just for a few hours. I need my sleep as much as everybody does.
  Grip, you sure remember that lizard koan of theirs:
  'The wise knows the angles, the wise knows what to do'.*"
"*Yeah!*"
"*Guess what, 'Wise' is a--*"
"*--a name?*"
"*Gives a whole new dimension to the 'others want to be wise' column,
  doesn't it?*"
"*So Newt picks younger lizards, and Wise picks brainier ones?*"
"*I guess First, Second and Third are not a picky bunch.*"
"*There's a Third?*"
"*But not a Fourth.
  I'm not entirely sure these three are regular names though.*"
"*I'm sorry, that's super interesting, but I've got one important thing to do.*"

Grip jumped at Lisa, Maria and Thalia chatting in the canteen:
"Why are you here?"
"As opposed to?" Maria turned to him.
"The lab! You had a day off, but we really, really have to start today--"
"I'm sorry, have you left already?"
"No, but--"
"--I had," Lisa raised her hand merrily.
"Then go ahead, form a queue, leave, and then we'll talk,"
 Maria was pulling out her phone with one hand and
 making inviting gestures towards Stalina with the free one.
 "Until then, I'm taking all the rest I can get.
  So, when I said 'bikes on tracks' yesterday,
  that was precisely what I meant. Bikes, on tank tracks,"
 she showed her the picture.
 "Yes, they do exist."
"OK, wow--"
"I know."
"... I mean... nice, but, at this rate, might as well go for hovers."
"What are you gonna do with a hover, they--"
"Where have you been? Why don't you reply?" Grip switched to Thalia.
She burst into laughter, interrupting the hovers discussion:
"That's-- that's probably for the better that you got no reply--
 because that'd be--"
"Wait," his face dropped. "Your phone, it can contact Fist. Direct-- ...ly."
That was the first time Grip saw a cyborg sprint.
