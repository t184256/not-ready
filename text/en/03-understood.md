As something large began unsticking from his back,
Grip convulsed involuntarily and went awake for a second.
He was being carried somewhere, and, once put down,
fell back into deep sleep.

Next time Grip woke up much later, well-rested,
on a bed that was both too large and too tall for him.
The air was so hot, the thin suit was a life-saver.
A night stand offered two shot glasses, a phone and a hooded suit.
Grip reached for the phone;
there were no news altogether.
The contact list had the following people active:

* Daniel Washington
* Helga Voronov
* Irakli Kosmovich Shpreigl
* Lee Cheng
* Lisa Frei
* Maria Stinner
* Stalina Filantievna Ivanova

The room was less of a room and more of a flimsy, hastily assembled section
in a hangar of sorts. The door was outright missing from the door frame.
Nobody lined up to drag Grip through another hazy montage of places to be,
things to ponder and people to forget.
Not in the room, not behind the corner.
Grip ventured further, and, a turn later, got spotted by a burly woman
carrying a long pole.

"*Grip! Good morning, how was your sleep?*"
"*Great, thank you.*"

His head didn't hurt this time, and the Arkadian lightness went away,
something he only noticed just now.
The woman briefly toyed with her phone.
A brief quiet symphony of noises spread around the hangar,
someone stood up nearby.

"*General assembly?*"
"*Uh-huh. Let's lug that thing over there, then we'll go meet the others.*"

Grip grabbed the rear end of pole, and they carried it through the hallway
into a mostly empty section.
It didn't look like his assistance was particularly useful.

"*I'm Stalina Filantievna, I--, well, housekeeping's on me.
  If you need something, personal or for work, that'd be my duty to help.
  Halt-- put it here and let's go to the canteen.*"

The station looked like it was undergoing some renovations and repartitioning.
Half of the sections were empty, some were packed with who-knows-what.
Stalina Filantievna picked up a display on their way,
and placed it on a large table in the canteen.
Grip wouldn't call that room a "canteen", by the way:
a canteen is supposed to have trays, racks and tables,
not armchairs and a sofa.
But "kitchen" suited it even worse, as kitchen is where people cook.

Stalina Filantievna poured him a glass of water,
while explaining what sort of food do they have
and where the showers and restrooms are.
Grip took a quick peek,
and the facilities sure didn't live up to his space tech expectations.
If anything, they were something in between the ones at home
and the ones at school.

By the time he returned,
the canteen was much more agitated.
The large sofa gained two young ladies;
Thalia stormed in, stomping loudly,
greeted everyone and jumped into one of the armchairs.
The last one to enter the room was a man of a ripe... well, an old man.
And the screen now featured two guys sitting next to each other.

"Welcome our new contact group, Thalia and *Grip*!" Stalina Filantievna began.
"Hello! Have fun down there!" one of the guys greeted them warmly.
 "I'm Dan, and it sure is boring up here."
"Our communications genius," the old man remarked quietly.
Grip tilted his head back at him.
"And this is Lee," Stalina Filantievna continued.
 "His area of expertise is flying. And everything power now."
"*Hi*," Lee greeted them in Russian for some reason.
 He was rather... reserved? Humble?
"You're an astrophysicist, aren't you, Lisa?"
"At least that's what my diplomas say. Long story,"
 the black-haired lady smiled back.
"Maria is our resident biologist--"
"That's right, all about the local lifeforms," the other one nodded.
"And last, but not least, *Irakli Kosmovich*,"
 Stalina Filantievna gestured towards the old man.
 "Our expert on languages, dead or alive."
"Mostly the dead ones," Irakli Kosmovich concluded after some contemplation.
"Thalia's one famous spy--"
"Not by a conventional definition--," Thalia began to argue.
"--and *Grip* translated that tale about a hen..."
"Nice to meet you," Grip greeted his smiling colleagues.
"I still don't get it, by the way," Maria admitted.
"It's OK, don't sweat it," Stalina Filantievna reassured her.
"Good job with the translation," Irakli Kosmovich praised Grip.

"What happened to the previous contact group?" Thalia asked.
"Straight to the point. I like her," Dan pointed at her.
"We, uh, messed up," Maria picked the words carefully.
 "Chances are, lizards don't want to talk to us any more."
"Off to a great start, aren't we," Thalia rolled her eyes.
 "How bad is the situation?"
"At one point they went as far as to state
 'you're here, we don't talk, you're not here',"
 Irakli Kosmovich slowly quoted.
 "The exact meaning of that is, of course, up to interpretation,
  but it's not that hard to arrive at one
  where they no longer want to talk to us
  and would rather prefer us to leave."
"Now you're just being dramatic," Stalina Filantievna shook her head.
 "Right after that they were reminded they've agreed to grade the essays,
  and they had no problem doing that.
  Maybe they liked yours so much,
  or maybe they forgot what they've said before,
  but they've subsequently agreed to meet with a new group in the end."
"'New of ours speak to new of yours, new of yours speak to new of ours'"
 Irakli Kosmovich proclaimed monotonously.
 "Again, we're not really sure
 'new' means 'younglings' and not just 'new faces',
  but we've decided to seize the opportunity and phase out most of the crew--
"To give them some rest, long overdue," Lisa interjected.
"--and try to reignite the lizards' interest
 with an all-new contact group of kids."
"We already went without contact for one evening,"
 Maria said in a worrying tone.

Grip lost count of all the new English words they used,
but, somehow, the general meaning still was unambiguous and easy to infer.

"What did we do wrong the last time?" Grip asked.
"We're not supposed to tell you,"
 Irakli Kosmovich said slowly.
 "We want a fresh start, and we don't want you to inadvertently
  fall into the same rut."
"But if we don't know what offended them the last time,
 how... do we know what topic to avoid?" Grip insisted.
The adults in the room exchanged quick glances,
but the guys from above might've missed that altogether.
"Well, that's an easy one: technology," Dan answered.
 "Our lil' friends are afraid of our machines.
  Or, at least, very suspicious of them.
  Not entirely surprising, given they have none of their own--"
"We're not sure about that," Lee interrupted him.
"We, uh, true, they're quite secretive when the discussion comes to them,
 but it's been almost two years and not a single thing suggests they do."
 Dan clarified.
 "At this point, I'd be surprised if it turns out they do use tools after all,
  and it's safe to assume they've got no spaceships. And no computers.
  They don't understand this stuff, and they're scared of it.
  And I can't blame them, prehistoric humans would be scared as well.
  So, fellas, think twice before showing them... pretty much everything,
  they might not like it."
"Good point. Since we're having a fresh start,
 ask for their explicit approval before bringing anything,"
 Stalina Filantievna agreed with him.
"They call tech 'complex objects'," Irakli added.

"So, what's our goal?" Thalia asked.
"Well, for starters, secure yourselves a second conversation,"
 Irakli Kosmovich stretched out the words.
 "The rest can wait."
"Splendid," Thalia replied dryly. "That's not helping."
"Do you have any other advice?" Grip attempted a more constructive approach.
A second round of exchanging glances ensued.
Oblivious to the tension, Dan defused it once again:
"Don't step on any."
"Yeah, that sounds like a bad start of a diplomatic mission,"
 Grip concluded with a straight face once the laughter subsided.

"How have we met? Originally? And how do we meet now?" Thalia inquired.
This story was also supposed to be secret,
but, at the same time, too good not to share,
so the adults all jumped at the opportunity to retell it.

Epsilon Indi explorers landed on the third planet,
because it had life and life is always interesting.
Johnny was a geologist
(and the life of the party, judging by how warmly he was remembered).
One day, when he needed to measure one more thing,
he did everything by the book:
ventured out for 750 meters almost straight ahead, and placed a probe.
The next day, when he returned to pick it up, he saw a lizard
observe him calmly instead of immediately running away.
Johnny observed it back, extracted the probe,
and almost went back, when he
noticed an isosceles right triangle drawn in the sand next to the lizard.
So, Johnny being Johnny, he drew two more under the first one,
and gasped, as the lizard merrily drew three more.
Johnny then proceeded to act naturally, i.e.,
dropped the probe and ran for the ship,
while flailing his arms and being generally inarticulate
on how exactly are lizards talking to him through straight triangles.
The rest of the crew acted naturally as well, i.e,
apprehended and sedated him as soon as he left the airlock,
then started arranging his early return.
But the next day Johnny kept sticking to his story,
insisting he doesn't want to go back home, but rather back to the desert.
When he was escorted there, they found not just the probe,
but also two lizards plus the writing on the sand
later translated as "we are here".
One of the lizards was running around,
while the second one made "hurr-durr"-like sounds.
And that's how people and lizards established a meeting place.
For a while people went there in planet suits;
later they've built an entire meeting dome,
one that Grip and Thalia would use now for their diplomatic activities.

"All right, but before I show you your workplace
 and let you roam around the base freely: safety training. Safety first!"

Thalia and Grip followed Stalina Filantievna along the broad hallway
dividing the base into Fist and Federation halves.
At the centre of the base this hallway widened even further,
encircling two untidy boxes with wires growing on them in thick bunches
and leading to some racks further down the hall.
These turned out to be teleports that Thalia and Grip had arrived through.

The hangar they were in was a ship no longer fit for flight,
and, in case of an emergency, they were supposed
to use pods, not teleports.
Two pods, each able to seat ten, were always ready to bring them to the
Fed ship at the orbit, and, from there,
they could be teleported back home in peace.
Formally, one was a Fed pod and another one was a Fist pod,
but they should've just run for whichever one was the closest.

Stalina Filantievna led them to the first pod, showed them a large red button
and pressed a different, smaller one.
The screens lit up to show Dan and Lee:
"Long time no see!" Dan greeted them.
 "The only thing you need to remember is that red button.
  There's another one, go find it!"

The second pod across the base was a mirror image of the first one.
"And here's the second one, yeah.
 When something bad happens, press the red button, and I'll pull you up here.
 Be careful though, and I hope you'll never use this knowledge,"
 Lee summed it up.

"Got any more questions?"
 Stalina Filantievna asked once she made sure they both remembered what to do.
"What else do people have? On this planet?"

(Stalina was irritated at how those kids ask questions.
But if she thought it was yet another fad she can't keep up with ---
distorting the language outside
the confines of tightly regulated grammar and phonetics ---
she couldn't be more wrong.
The question intonation swings actually affected all ages alike ---
it was lizard, even when studied in its written form exclusively,
that left this specific mark on how its practitioners spoke.
Time and time again, the intonation peak crept earlier and earlier,
occasionally missing the logic of either language;
then came multi-peaking, and, finally, breaking sentences up.
Most of the affected didn't pay enough attention
to this impact of lizard on humans'.)

"Let me see," Stalina Filantievna frowned.
 "Not much, really. The ship, the pods, the solar panels--
  two ships: this ship, the ship in the orbit,
  and a small comms satellite. And the dome. I bet you want to see the dome."
Thalia stormed off to pick up her planet suit,
Grip had to be led to his room.

They reunited at the airlock,
where Stalina lapsed into yet another lecture on safety.
Turned out, the local air she characterized
as "sorta wretched, even the lizards prefer ours" was deceptively safe.
That made the smell useful,
as one would instantly know they're breathing wrong air.
It wasn't immediately deadly or anything:
in the absence of any better options,
humans could survive for up to half an hour on local air alone,
especially if they were to minimize their physical activity.
In case of an emergency,
running back to the ship without a suit wasn't off the table.
Even though, officially, it violated the safety protocols, under which
they were supposed to wear "these fine soft suits of yours,
no longer featuring all the imaginable state-of-the-art technology
we had to painstakingly strip to, you know, put the lizards at ease".
After learning how to insert the air tabs,
they've put the planet suits on.
It soon became obvious why they couldn't learn all of that on the go:
sealed up correctly,
the hood-helmet did an excellent job of dampening their voices.
Without the comms in their suits,
talking was an exhausting activity for everyone involved:
one would need to shout,
and the others would still have to stop moving and focus on listening.

Once they got over the shouting part,
Stalina Filantievna opened the hatch at last.
It was really hot out there.
An endless desert stretched around them,
with only a couple of cacti on the horizon, here and there.
And a transparent dome in front of them,
looking blatantly out of place.
Stalina Filantievna gave them time to look around,
then invited them to follow her with a gesture.
They walked towards the dome in silence.
Approximately a hundred meters in diameter,
the dome loomed impractically large and suspiciously empty.
Up close, it looked even more transparent than regular glass.
Grip's gaze bounced between the dome and the sand beneath his feet,
as if he was comparing them.

They've entered the already open airlock:
a small bubble stuck to a large bubble.
Stalina Filantievna pressed a button,
which, unexpectedly, was a single one for both doors:
the outer one fizzed, hissed and rustled close,
in sync with the inner one opening up.
She removed the hood without waiting for the switch to complete;
the kids followed her example.
"That's how the local air tastes like, take a whiff.
 So, this is what I meant by 'handy',
 with a smell like that, you won't miss a suit malfunction."

The local air was, indeed, unpleasant, slightly bitter and not deadly.
It was already yielding to the air that was much more familiar,
but served way over the comfortable temperature.
Were they to wander the local desert,
the heat would likely pose a more immediate problem than the air.
"It's hot in here!"
Thalia nodded in agreement enthusiastically.
"It's not that bad," Stalina Filantievna replied disapprovingly,
 "it's just a seven-hundred-meter walk,
  and then you can take off your planet suits.
  Mind that you'll be meeting at sunset, when it's gonna be much cooler.
  This," she gestured vaguely towards the sun,
  "This is too hot for the lizards themselves."

From the inside, the dome looked even larger and emptier.
The closer half featured a glass floor, the further half was sand.
The airlock for lizards was on the other side,
and looked, like, five times smaller.
On the left, there was a stool with a water tank on it and... that was it.
Nothing else in the entire giant dome.
"So, here's your workplace!"

Grip was disappointed, looking around for more.
He wandered around, as if somebody invited him over but moved out,
and now Grip's hoping for the hosts to show up and explain themselves.
Thalia, disappointed over a multitude of other reasons,
questioned Stalina Filantievna:
"What do we do? If something happens to us here?"
"Like what?"
"I don't know, anything! What if a lizard bit us? Say..."
"I'm not sure they-- uh, anyway, if something threatens your safety,
 just put on your suits and run for the ship."
"But what if my suit gets broken?"
"Send *Grip* back for help."
"What if both our suits get broken? Then what?"
"... in that unlikely case, either walk back without the suits, or,
 if it's safer to stay here,
 just stay here, and we'll come pick you up, eventually."
"Look, I'm just saying I'd like it much more if we had radios or something."
"And I'm saying it's not a walk in the park, young lady.
 You're on a mission. On a frontier planet.
 And as far as space exploration goes, a very safe one,"
 Stalina answered coldly.
 "I don't think you two are gonna die out here,
  not unless you put some actual effort into it."
"Can you make us hats? From the same material?"
 Grip asked, fiddling with a hood of the planet suit.
 "I don't know what the evenings are like here,
  and I'm worried about the heat...
  If we need to stay here for long. And it sounds like we'll have to."
"... Yeah, your clothes could use some hood. We'll see.
 I'll print you two some caps or something."

They walked around aimlessly, for there was nothing to look at.
"Is there anything else here? Except the water and the chair?"
"The air tube."
Stalina Filantievna led them back to the airlock.
The wall next to it featured a hole and a tube,
softly blowing in relatively cold air.
"Anything else?"
"No, not really. Whatever stuff we had here, we've moved it back to the base.
 Tell me if you need something, and I'll print it."

As excitement yielded to nervousness,
the base started looking like a backside of a yawn-inducing dark brown barn,
with only a small entrance in the middle.
Stalina showed them the button to open the hatch;
they've left the planet suits at the bay.
Grip asked to show him the way to Irakli Kosmovich,
while Thalia went some place else.

The old man sat at a desk full of papers,
with papers in one hand, reading a paper from the other hand.
He turned to the visitors and back to put all the papers into the right stacks:

"*Hello, hello, Grip.
  I was told to tutor you for a while.
  And I'm no teacher, not at all, so I'd like to apologize in advance for that.
  I'll do my best.*"
"*Uh, hello. Please, teach me to talk with the lizards.*"
"*Me? Na-ah.*"
Grip didn't expect that.
"*What do you mean? I need--*"
"*You'll be the one teaching me their language.
  It'd be all wrong, see,
  if you're the one talking to them first-hand, who am I to teach it to you?*"
"*But, wait, you sure know it better!*"
"*Yeah, maybe,*" -- his teacher smirked.
  "*But for how long? And modes-- Oh, let's test you,*"
  Irakli Kosmovich picked up a blank sheet from the blank stack:
  "*Go ahead, write down: 'I'm here'.*"

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
Grip took the mechanical pencil and wrote[^3], left-to-right:
"[exist] [here-in] [I']"
"*Tired... we're coming to you.*"
Grip jotted below:
"[we] [be-tired] [go] [yous']".
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*See, you already have something to talk about.*"
"*I can't talk, only write.*"
"*Heh, well, who can? But you can write.*"
"*On the sand?*"
"*Yeah, right. You write to them, they write back at you.*"
"*... I should give it a try.*"
"*Sure, go ahead, if you want to. But first, translate this one...*"
Irakli Kosmovich wrote down another line:
"[I] [be-proper-?]"
Grip started scribbling "*Am I*", then proceeded with "*proper?*":
"*This one used to be translated as 'good', but now it's 'proper',*"
 he commented.
"*Correct,*" Irakli Kosmovich nodded in approval,
  "*We've realized 'good' doesn't suit--
    Boy, you really are more fluent when
    writing in their language than in your native one!
    OK, eh, you know what,
    I suppose you have more than enough on your plate for the first days.
    I'll report that you're studying Russian for the first couple of days,
    and you can just practice some handwriting.
    I do hope you'll be taking notes out there.*"
"*Guess I'll need a simpler pencil,*"
  Grip said, examining the writing implement once he was done with the word.
"*I don't... Nah, you know better. That's fine, they like simpler things,*"
  Irakli Kosmovich changed his mind mid-sentence.
  "*Give me this one back then.*"
"*So, what will you be teaching me, languages? Linguistics?*"
"*No, the other way around, no languages.
  You can practice English with Thalia, lizard -- with lizards.*"
Grip frowned, but didn't argue.
"*I'll be tutoring you on the other subjects:
  maths, history, whatever else you have these days.
  As I said, I'm no teacher, so I'll do my best.
  Classes, eh? Now go do something less boring.*"

Grip found his room all by himself.
He decided to order a plasticless, solid graphite pencil,
noticed a missed text from Thalia: "*come here, we need to talk*",
admitted that he doesn't know where, and, in the end, she paid him a visit.

"*We need a plan--,*" she began upfront.
"*No.*"
She raised an eyebrow back at Grip, sat on the other side of the bed:
"*Uh, what's your problem?*"
"*My problem is, you're an agent.*"
"*... and you?*"
"*And I'm a *valenok*, remember?*"
"*That remains to be seen,*" she commented offhandedly.
Grip threw up his hands instead of answering.
"*Anyway, what was the problem again?*"
"*If lizards really wanted to talk with our kids,
  I don't think they meant 'send in your little spies.'*"
"*I'm not a spy. I'm an agent and a diplomat.*"
"*'your little agents and diplomats'. Better?*"
"*So? What are you proposing?
  Send in some unprepared kids instead of diplomats?*"
Grip waved his hand, at loss for words.
"*That's a recipe for... calamity,*" she continued.
Her Russian was good, but not ideal.
"*I kinda hope they understand that!
  And take into account that we're just kids. Somehow.
  But here's you.*"
"*I disagree, but I think I understand what you're talking about...*"

"*Alright, and what do you propose?*" Thalia broke the silence.
"*I don't know," Grip replied. "Can you just act? ... like a normal kid?*"
"*You bet,*" said the spy caught twice while pretending to be a normal kid.
"*Yeah, right.*"
"*And you?*"
"*Me? I am a normal kid!*"
Thalia took offence at that.
"*And so am I,*" she replied after a while,
  "*I'm not some kid-shaped monster. I've got parents, friends, hobbies...*"
"*Like what?*" Grip tried to defuse it.
"*I play soccer... when I've got a place to play,*"
  Thalia got shy out of nowhere.
  "*But usually I don't, so I solve crosswords.*"
The silence grew to awkward lengths.
"*Whatever,*" Thalia agreed out of nowhere.
  "*So be it. It's not like I know what am I doing anyway.*"
She moved back to slump against the wall.
"*I don't know what they need,*" she continued.
  "*And I don't know what we can offer. These talks are gonna go just great.*"
"*I don't even know how do we talk,*" Grip contributed to the list.
"*Write in the sand?*" Thalia wondered.
"*I guess? Should we practice that beforehand?...*"
"*Cool. I'm all for it,*" Thalia hopped down already. "*Let's find Stalina*".

Thalia led Grip to the teleports.
Stalina Filantievna waited in front of one.
Once she noticed the kids,
she fished two thin soft hats out of her numerous pockets:
"Your pencil isn't ready yet. And neither is your stuff."
"We wanna go outside again," Thalia proclaimed.
"I want to practice writing in the sand,"
 Grip clarified after giving up on figuring out
 which language to speak and with whom.
Stalina Filantievna didn't expect that, but had no objections.

"Could you print us a ball?" Thalia asked along the way.
"What, a ball? What for?"
"To play soccer!"
"Nonsense! This is a research station, young lady, not a soccer field."
"We can play outside," Thalia kept pressing.
"Oh, cosmos!" Stalina Filantievna protested with extra vigor.
 "When I said you're unlikely to die outside,
  I meant, from walking to the dome and back.
  Not that you should go play soccer!
  This isn't your backyard!"

This time it was Thalia who opened the hatch.
It was cooler, but still hot.
The sun wasn't touching the horizon yet, but it was close.
And, next to it, there was a moving dark patch.
"Look!" Grip shouted and extended the hand to cover the sun.
It's unlikely that his companions made out the word,
yet they also looked the same direction.
A patch was swarming closer, and it became clear in a minute
that it's made of lizards.
At any given moment, part of them were running, and part of them were standing,
alternating between the states all the time.
Focusing at individual lizards
evoked a mesmerizing impression of orderly movement,
but the swarm as a whole roamed chaotically and unsteadily.
It was coming closer at first, aiming more for the dome than for the ship,
before taking a hard turn all of a sudden,
passing behind the dome and heading somewhere else entirely.

Grip snapped out of it, remembered what he was after,
and started writing in the hot sand:
"[I] [show] [signs']".
It came out really large, so he then tried to write as densely as he could:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [see] [you']".
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Dry sand didn't lend itself to compact writing at all.
Thalia watched that from the above, then also sat down to write:
"[I] [show] [signs']".
Unsure of what to do next, they stood in silence for a while
before returning to the ship.

"We should get ready," Thalia said nervously.
 "We must be there by sunset."
Grip picked up his pencil, grabbed a sheet of paper, then
waited at the bay for Thalia, who returned composed and expressly serious.
The sun almost touched the horizon as they headed out again
and walked to the dome in silence.
The paper and pencil were left at the airlock, just in case,
and so were the planet suits.

They walked to the centre of the dome and sat down
where the glass gave way to the sand.
After settling down for a bit,
Grip squinted at the small airlock in front of them,
and noticed a lizard in it!
It was lying across, motionless, making no attempts to open the inner door.
"*You see that? A lizard!*" Thalia whispered.
"*Yes,*" Grip whispered back.
"*What do we do? Should we let it in?*"
"*No! Wait.*"
Thalia squirmed impatiently on the hot glass, Grip tried to move slower.
The lizard seemed perfectly comfortable with the standstill
that showed no sign of resolution.

"*Over there!*"
  Thalia accidentally elbowed Grip when pointing
  and shifted further to the right.
  "*Sorry. Do you see it!*"
Indeed!
Breathless, Grip watched a much smaller lizard running towards the airlock.
Running. Stopping. Running. Stopping almost there. Lurching again--
and biting the large one behind its hindlegs??! The large one turned abruptly,
sending a lot of sand flying into the air, and fled,
while the smaller one nosebumped the button and entered the dome.
Thalia gave Grip a quick puzzled side-glance.
His eyes were locked on the lizard.
Here it comes. Stops. Looks around. Runs to the centre. Stops. Runs.
Fifteen centimetres long? Twenty? No, at a closer look, more like twenty-five.
Very much like the pictures--, no,
the characteristic head is there, but it's built differently.
Stops across Grip and Thalia, eyes them up and begins rattling and writing.

They froze, as the lizard crawled towards them, with its tail
rustling through the sand to the beat of clicks and rattles,
inscribing to the side of its path:
"[exist] [here-in] [I']"
Grip rode out the anxiety wave and began redrawing the column,
Thalia followed suit, but slower:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [here-in] [I']"
"[exist] [here-in] [I']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

The lizard examined their columns
(what could it even see from the ground level?),
ran to the side and resumed the examination from there.
Then it started grunting, which bore no resemblance to rattling,
with heavy breathing clearly visible. "Hurr-durr?" Yes, quite similar.
The kids froze in place until it finished grunting
and produced another column:
"[I] [be-new]"

Grip and Thalia copied that one as well,
but the lizard walked unceremoniously across their inscriptions,
turned back at them and wrote:
"[up] [go] [down']
|[down] [go] [up']"

Its tail alternating left and right to write two columns at once
was so mesmerizing, that Grip did not move an inch,
until the lizard finished and turned to look at his hand.
Only then he reached out slowly to his scribbles, erased them carefully and
started drawing the very same
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist] [here-in] [I']"
|[I] [be-new]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
all over again, but upside down.
The lizard didn't seem to mind his hands moving nearby,
paying more attention to erasing than to writing.

Writing in joint, outwards and upside down was no simple task.
Doing that for two columns at once was out of question,
two hands or one hand. The column wasn't even straight when he used one hand.
Thalia hasn't even attempted fixing her writing,
waiting for the lizard's verdict.
It already assumed a position across them, tail to the side and ready to write.
As Grip finished the second column,
it walked towards his writing:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[up] [go] [up']
|[down] [go] [down']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

Grip sat straight, relieved.
Thalia, on the other hand, watched closely,
as the lizard ran to her side to write:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [want] [know'] [signs'] [yours-of]
|[I] [want] [know'] [sounds'] [yours-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

Grip has slowly wiped a wide stretch in front of him;
the lizard was as unfazed by his hands as the last time,
changing position as it saw fit.
Thalia rolled her eyes,
as she understood what is he writing: "*I GREET*", upside down.
As Grip pronounced the word loudly, like Maria Stepanovna did,
the lizard stopped to listen and raised its head just a little.
"[do-explain] | [aforementioned']" it then wrote without walking,
establishing that columns were meant to be read right to left.
That also implied that Grip's word was backwards from the lizard perspective,
as writing, as opposed to reading,
has to go left to right. Good for right-handers.
Grip untilted his head and slowly replied
towards the lizard's current position, column by column:
"[I] [see] [you'] | [I] [show] [aforementioned']"
"[signs] [be-many] | [sounds] [be-many]" it complained.
"*Well, duh,*" Thalia uttered, stretched out to the centre and wrote
 "HI".
Upside down and right to left, so, still backwards.
She then pronounced it three times,
pointing at the letters with every repetition.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[do-explain] | [aforementioned']"
 the lizard waved its tail towards the already written request.
"[I] [see] [you'] | [I] [show] [aforementioned']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Thalia rested her finger on another pre-written phrase.
"[signs] [be-many-not]
|[sounds] [be-many-not]" it concluded at the sidelines.
"Let's use English then," Grip said with grave seriousness
 and started erasing stuff, as he ran out of reachable space again.

"[yous] | [be-different-?]" the lizard asked in the meantime.
It didn't need to erase in advance.
"[we] [hold] [signs'] [be-different]
|[we] [hold] [sounds'] [be-different]"
 Thalia wrote.
Whatever both sides had in mind was painfully ambiguous,
yet the lizard looked content with the answer.
Grip was worried though.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [want] [know'] [signs'] [yours-of]
|[I] [want] [hold'] [signs'] [yours-of]"
"[hold-?] | [signs']" the lizard stood almost still, its tail swinging swiftly.
"[I] [hold] [object'] [signs-of]"
 Grip wrote down and ran out of glyphs to express the concept.
"[I] [understand-not] | [do-show] [aforementioned']"
Grip stood up slowly and fetched the paper together with the pencil.

"[do-see] [object'] | [aforementioned] [be-complex-?]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Grip wrote on the sheet of paper rested against the glass,
 then put it on the sand upside down.
The lizard inspected the paper for an inordinate amount of time,
its eyes almost touching the symbols,
checking it out from all possible directions.
"I don't think it can--" Thalia started to whisper,
 interrupting the lizard's examination.
It then ran to the side to reply:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[aforementioned] [be-complex-not]
|[aforementioned] [be-object-not]"
"[aforementioned] | [be-...-?]"
 Grip improvised, omitting the glyph itself
 and just prodding the empty space after the antestrokes.
"[aforementioned] | [be-substance]" the lizard "clarified",
 leaving Thalia to squint and frown at the answer.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

Grip handed the pencil for inspection to cover all the bases.
The lizard has circled it, rolled it with its head, with its leg,
dug below it...
"You think, it can see from below? Through the sand?"
"I doubt it."
@... and surfaced back,
arriving at the same conclusion and pointing at it with its tail:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[aforementioned] | [be-substance]"

"[yours] [eat-?] [animals'] | [ours] [eat] [animals']"
"[true]" Grip wrote.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Coming from Rosario, he probably never ate animal meat,
but the question was about the humans as a species.

Now yet another linguistic liberty dawned on him.
He reached further into the lizard's writing
and erased the antestroke from [eat-?], turning it into a slightly messy [eat].
The lizard retreated, followed the finger,
and, for a rather uncomfortable minute,
kept staring at the
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
@"[yours] [eat] [animals'] | [ours] [eat] [animals']",
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
now-ambiguous with regard to who [yours] and [ours] are.
Grip, obviously, could not read emotions off its face.
It was getting dark.
Finally, the lizard turned to them,
raising no objections to the invasion of its writings.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[yours] [hold] [animal'] | [animal] [hold-?] [food']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip turned to Thalia for support, she shook her head.
She was the first to overcome the acute context deficit though:
"[exist] [be-many] [animals] [ours-of]"
 she wrote slowly,
 making Grip doubt both her and his knowledge of the lizard language.
After frantically waving his hands above it,
with no obvious in-place fix in sight,
he felt compelled to clarify in a separate column:
"[exist] [be-many] [categories'] [animals-of] [be-different]"

The lizard wanted to know more:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [want] [see'] [animals'] [yours-of]
|[you] [can-?] [show'] [animals'] [yours-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Why is it so hard, huh?*" Grip grunted, replying:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [can] [show'] [signs'] [animals-of]"
The lizard looked at his belly. Puzzled? Waiting?
"[do-wait]" Grip wrote and turned to the paper.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Instead of waiting, the lizard climbed out onto the glass and watched him draw
from approximately its length away.
Grip sketched a lizard contour, examining a living reference from time to time.
Thalia moved to observe it from the other side,
fingers crossed for Grip's scribbles to not become the final nail
in the human-lizard relationships' coffin.
Slightly narrower here... tail... hindlegs...
Once he finished and inched back,
the lizard has nosebumped the result right here on the glass.
Upon returning to the sand it immediately stated:
"[?#1?] [be-sign-not] | [?#1?] [be-?#1?]"
Grip rushed to copy the new sign, Thalia hasn't commented at all
and looked distanced.
"*Do you know what does this sign mean?*" Grip asked.
"*Could be 'drawing'?*" she hasn't helped much.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [know-not] [sign'] [?#1?-of]
|[I] [can-?] [show'] [?#1?']"
.Grip improvised in the dark again.
"[do-know] | [signs']" the lizard either encouraged or mocked him.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

Grip stretched, looked towards the long-set sun
and then decided to pursue the opportunity to [know] some more [signs'].
There indeed were a couple of words he'd love to know.
"[do-wait]" he wrote before walking to the water keg.
There were no glasses, and he left the shots at the base,
so he ended up carrying the almost hot water back in his cupped hand.
Once he placed it on top of his [do-wait] glyph,
the lizard acted conflicted.
After struggling with indecisiveness,
it started rising and bending into his hand,
all while trying to avoid touching Grip.
He pressed the hand against the hot sand to help the lizard.
Finally, it touched the water, and Thalia started laughing quietly.
Grip smiled. The lizard kept poking the water with its mouth,
but neither lapped nor swallowed it. Just probed the water again and again.
Finally, it backed out, ran towards Thalia and wrote:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[rejoicing] [you-of] [be-proper-not]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip poured the water out, recapturing the entirety of the lizard's attention
for another minute and giving Thalia ample time to explain herself:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[rejoicing] [I-of] [be-different]
|[exist] [head-in] [aforementioned']"
"[can-not] [see'] | [head'] [you-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 it answered once its fascination with wet sand wore off.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
Grip didn't want a conflict, he wanted to [know] [signs']:
"[I] [hold] [aforementioned'] | [do-show] [sign'] [aforementioned-of]"
"[exist-not] [aforementioned'] [ours-of] | [exist] [?#2?'] [ours-of]"
Grip grabbed the pencil again.
The glyph got more complex, the night got darker.
Thalia practiced writing the new sign upside-down, then extended it to:
"[do-explain] [?#2?']"
"[can-not] [explain'] [?#2?']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Like, it's not just you who can't, but it's impossible?
  Come on. Think, lizard, think,*"
  Grip muttered.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[we] [want] [know'] [?#2?']" he pressured on.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
The lizard looked at his knees and wrote nothing.
Grip pointed at the last column again.
"[I] | [think]" the lizard brushed him off in writing and rattling.
The sounds obviously matched the writing, and,
coupled with the tail movements, helped with the darkness greatly.
If Grip got distracted back then and missed all the hints,
he'd have to figure out the reply until the very dawn.
Starting from where to find that reply.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [can] [see'] [be-less-er] [signs'] | [I] [can-not] [see'] [signs']"
 he wrote with hesitation,
 out of column sync and unsure whether the sentence structure was legit.
"[I] [can] [see'] [signs']" the lizard replied in one column.
"*I'm so happy for you,*" Grip vented.

"[I] [can-?] [hold'] [substance']
|[substance] [hold] [here-in] [sun']"
"[substance] [can-not] [be-sun']
| [object] [aforementioned] [be-complex-?]"
"[substance] [hold] | [inside-in] [sun']"
 Grip explained fluorescence the best he could.
"[aforementioned] [be-sun-?] | [aforementioned] [be-danger-?]"
"[substance] [be-sun-not] | [substance] [be-hot-not]"
"[be-sun-not] [can-not] [hold'] [sun']
|[do-go] [do-hold] [here'] [aforementioned']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"How to say 'next time'?" Grip wondered aloud. "We've got no words for time."
Thalia didn't comment, but moved closer.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[we] [go] [living place'] | [exist] [here-in-?] [you']"
"[true-not]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Thalia sprung into writing:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[we] [go] [here'] | [you] [go-?] [here']"
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [here-in] [I'] [exist] [here-in] [I']
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Thalia exhaled with great relief.
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [here-in] [we'] [exist] [here-in] [we']"
Grip sealed the agreement.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[do-go] [do-hold] [?#1?s'] [animals-of] [be-small-er]
|[do-go] [do-hold] [substance'] [aforementioned] [be-sun]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 the lizard instructed.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [go] [hold] [?#1?s'] [animals-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
 Grip started reassuring, and came up with another idea:
"[I] [go] [hold] [substance']
|[substance] [aforementioned] [help] [see']"
The lizard got tired of expressing its doubt in the magical properties
of human materials.
Thalia was puzzled as well:
"Wanna order him glasses?" she asked half-jokingly.
"*I want to bring a magnifying glass,*" Grip replied.
Thalia didn't know the Russian word, Grip didn't know the English one.
"[we] | [go]" he wrote and started standing up.
"[I] | [go]" the lizard wrote as well, then ran away with two short stops.
Quiet door hissing marked its exit.

"*We did it!*" Thalia stretched out in a tired voice.
"*Ye-ea-a-h,*" Grip mirrored her intonation.
"*You're good with their language, for real.*"
"*It was hard.*"
"*Uh-huh. Couldn't see a thing by the end.*"

Turned out, the ship featured three red lights,
very handy when you're aiming for the entrance after sunset.
On their way back, Grip broke his stride several times when he saw
a large lizard nearby, but decided against telling Thalia.
Stopping to point fingers and shout "look, a lizard"
just felt like an impolite thing to do on a planet of lizards.
In the airlock Thalia asked him:
"*Did you see them? Lizards on our way back...*"
"*Yes. They live here, actually.*"

Kids took off the planet suits and went to the buzzing canteen.
The buzz stopped once they entered the scene,
with Dan being the last to stop talking.
"How did it go? Took you a while,"
 Stalina Filantievna voiced it for everyone.
"There will be a second meeting," Grip replied and the cheerful buzz resumed.
"It even drank from Grip's hand!"
 Thalia squeaked merrily, further fueling the cheering.
"Are you all right?" Maria asked him out of nowhere.
"I'm fine, it didn't-- hasn't even touched me,"
 Grip shrugged her off and realized
 he's so. fed. up. with. languages. Every single one of them.

He told everyone he's off to bed,
left Thalia in the spotlight that has since shifted from the door frame
to the couch, washed his hands and headed to his room,
firmly determined to get some sleep.
Greeted by the furious flashing of his phone,
he groaned and put the pencil and paper onto the bed.
"*'Agent. Report.' Derevyashko.*" displayed the phone after unlocking.
Just what he needed right now!
"*'Situation normal. Your agent. Sleep.'*", Grip wrote back,
 flipped the phone, climbed into bed and fell asleep.
