"Grip!"
The voices fizzled out one by one.
"... over my dead body,"
 his attention latched onto Thalia's figure of speech.
 One curious figure--
"Grip!" Maria persisted.
 "I know you're not gonna crush it,
  but I'd really appreciate if you didn't test-- thank you.
  Thank you very much."
Much to her and Newt's appreciation,
Grip sat straight and stared at her, scrambling for words,
then cleared his throat and demanded:
"Can we. just. discuss it. Like normal people?"
"Note how none of us are jumping you to pry it out of your--
 uh, white knuckled hands,"
 Lisa remarked, disgruntled.
"So you do realize now," Stalina took initiative,
 "what horrible things could happen if Newt goes to their--"
"--US?!" Maria shrieked, blown away by her audacity.
 "Then imagine what happens if Feds get mind control!"
That... scenario... didn't make Grip feel any better.
"Or we can both take one scan each."
 Derevyashko suggested in an extra thick accent. "After all--"
"How about nobody gets him," Grip interrupted him.
 "Are you serious? They're sentient, we're sentient,
  how can you even think about it? That's... wrong twice."
"Why did you bring him in then?" Lisa wondered.
"--What's wrong with you?--" Thalia hissed under her breath.
"... to copy him," Grip replied, his heart sinking again.
Maria raised her arms in exasperation.
"... but can't you just copy him? Without scanning--"
"--exactly do you think this--"
"--or erase the scan after--"
"Would you trust her to delete it?!"
 Thalia's semi-hiss came off bewildered. Betrayed.
"No. I don't think so."
Grip finally let go of the jar and massaged his temples,
looking Newt in the eyes.
He stood with his front legs up the wall, examining Grip.
"Then we must never let them--"
"--but we need to--"
"--I know, but can't you see? We can't--"
"This is getting ridiculous," Maria leaned back.
"No, this is serious," Grip objected.
 "Mind control is serious. What if they take over--"
"--We're not worrying about them taking over humans,"
 Dmytro Ivanovich weighed in.
 "That would be ridiculous indeed."
"Aren't you afraid you'll print thousands of them,
 put them inside people's heads, and then it turns out they have telepathy?
 And now they're a superbrain with people--"
"Grip, we're an advanced space-faring civilization
 spread over hundreds of planets.
 And we control what travels between them.
 They'd be lucky to capture one. And that's if telepathy is real."

"Grip. Why do you want to copy him in the first place?"
 Maria changed the subject.
"Newt wants to, they're dying! And they can't make more of them."
"You wanna tell me they can't procreate?"
"I don't know what is--"
"What did he say? Tell me exactly what he said, without making anything up."
"In English or without making anything up?" Thalia's voice dripped of sarcasm.
"It wasn't him, it was the Second," Grip corrected.
"A second one?" the room went abuzz. "What second lizard?"
"The Second is the name," Thalia was quick to clarify.
"Of the other lizard," Grip added.
"Stop pulling my leg--" Maria began.
"--no, it's true!--" Thalia insisted.
"--and tell it from the start."

"There were two of them this time," Thalia began. "Newt and another, big one."
"A parent, huh?" Derevyashko asked, amused.
"They don't have parents," Grip took over. "They were created all together."
"And whatever created them...?" Maria didn't like what she heard.
"Gone," Thalia answered.
"And when I asked what its sign is, it wrote 'second'," Grip continued.
 "So I asked how many of them are there, and it said 'nine' and 'two'."
 "I asked 'eleven?' and it said 'yes'."
"Are you sure that's not just its siblings? Family? Tribe?"
"It said there were more before, but now it's just eleven."
"So, I'm supposed to believe this entire planet has eleven sentient lizards
 with three forms of 'you' between the eleven of them?"
"That doesn't prove anything," Irakli Kosmovich spoke for the first time.
 "Other than there are more than three."
"Eleven or not, Newt wants us to make more of them,"
 Thalia steered the discussion.
"And the other one?" Maria wondered.
"... does not... object to it," Thalia picked the words carefully.
"Because it doesn't care now," Grip was quick to clarify.
 "Because Newt is no longer part of them, because he killed me--"
"--the Second was furious!"
"Oh, he was furious when he learned that Newt left his body for a walk.
 But when he learned he killed me, he was so angry he tried to climb me!"
"He means, to get to Newt."
"Yes, to chew off Newt's tail!"
"... Wow," Lisa voiced it for everyone.
"So, Grip thinks Newt is exiled now," Thalia summed it up.
 "I'm not so sure, but I can say they don't take killing lightly."
"There's just eleven of them..."
 Derevyashko didn't make it clear
 whether it was an argument for exile or against it.

That reminded Maria of something:
"We'd better fix their natural reproduction mechanism,
 rather than just copying them."
"It said the thing no longer exists," Thalia shook her head.
"So, all we have is Newt," Lisa reasoned. "And, either way, we scan him."
"Why is it always like this..." Grip grasped for words.
 "You find one new good thing, and also twenty-five... bad ways to use it."
"My dad says, this is how it is," Thalia wasn't thrilled about it either.
 "And I should just accept it."
On the opposite side of the room, Lisa asked Maria something,
and they started arguing in quiet, worried voice.
"I don't want to, and I will not," Grip hugged the jar tighter.

"Look at you, saving the world from Newt," Thalia found it funny.
"*I'm not trying to save the world!
  We're finally not alone in the universe,
  we're supposedly the smarter, advanced ones,
  and I want them to cut all the us versus them silliness,*"
 Grip switched languages for expressiveness.
Newt interrupted his usual thing of silently tracking who's speaking
to quietly express his displeasure
about his jar shaking too much as Grip gets carried away.
"--doesn't survive, I'll become the most famous zoologist anyway."
 Maria's nervous joke filled the pause.
"I'm sorry you're the smartest and most advanced one in the room,
 but they just aren't there yet,"
 Thalia didn't mock Grip, she mocked the adults.
 "I also want them to get over it in peace."
"*Peace? That's why you became a spy, for peace?*"
  Grip misunderstood who was the primary target of her derisive remark.
"*Back then I could neither walk nor talk.*"
"*Can confirm*,"
 Derevyashko weighed in nostalgically from the other side of the couch.
"*Urgh, fine, fight each other for all you want, that's not even the worst.
  They want to shove sentient into sentient, and they won't ask anyone.*"
"*They sure won't,*" Thalia echoed bitterly.
"*And I couldn't care less whether it'd be yours or ours who won't.*"
"*Oh, neither will.*"
"*And you're ready to live like this? For the rest of your life?
  With a lingering thought that a sentient worm could crawl in,
  take the wheel and control you?*"
"*Pfft! With what?!*" she burst out into giggling, making the room go quiet.
 "*Also, I'm vaccinated-- wait, no, it's against-- ... dying.*"
"*Pum-pum-pum,*" Grip vocalized. "*How's your neck, no longer itchy?*"

"*Yeah, now when they know what they want, they're gonna find a way.
  If we free Newt now, they'll comb the desert and try them one by one--
  OK, maybe not,*" she said with a glimmer of hope.
 "*That's not exactly good-looking, diplomatically speaking.*"
"*You know what's awesome?*" Grip pointed towards the ceiling.
 "*They still don't know a thing.*"
"*Yeah,*" Thalia agreed wholeheartedly. "*In a way, I'm glad you died.*"
"*No comms and vaccinated,*" Grip nodded. "*All pros, no cons.*"
"*Kinda... Sorry.*"
"*Oh, it's not you I'm angry at right now,
  it's, like, our dumpster of a world,*"
 he raised the voice to address the entire room.
 "Could you, please, bring the cage?"
"The cage?" Stalina echoed.
"Yes, the one where the ambassador could, you know, stretch his tail."
"Like, here?"
"Yeah, yeah, what are you waiting for?"
She reluctantly obliged.

"What do you think?"
"Me?"
Dmytro Ivanovich raised his palm as if he was looking right through it.
"You should start planning your time off. How about in three days?"
"So that you all can copy him--"
"No, I said in three days. Three days later. Where would you want to go?"
"Home? But that's, like, the least important thing now."
"I don't want to you to work yourself all the way to an actual mental breakdown.
 Especially if it occurs in the middle of important negotiations
 instead of a middle of the night."
"But look what's happening--"
"Precisely, there's always a more interesting thing coming,
 but one more week is the most I'm gonna give you."
"Look, how am I supposed to relax?" Grip hugged the jar tighter.
"I need at least one of them on board," Maria raised her voice.
 "Somebody needs to make it sit straight, and the thing inside it.
  And I'll need the comms back. And all the help I can get."
The last bit was directed at Lisa, who nodded back at her reluctantly.
Thalia rubbed her eyes.
"*Do you know what are they talking about?*" Grip quietly asked her.
"*She helps her think. That's not important right now,*" she whispered back.
Unexpectedly, this made Derevyashko nod understandingly,
as if now everything made sense,
which only confused Grip further.
"*Please, have some mercy at me,*" he begged Thalia.
"*They link their brains. With a wire. To think quicker.*"
Grip's face was skewing harder with every bit of new information divulged.
"*Better tell me, what are we gonna tell Newt,*"
 Thalia didn't find brain linking interesting.
"*Like what, don't control people? Don't let them control people with you?*"
"*Grip, he basically lives inside a lizard. I don't think he can relate--*"
"*--not what I mean.*"
Stalina returned with the cage.
"*And what did you mean?*"
"*I've got a question to the moral facet of your personality.
  Isn't it compelled to tell him he's surrounded by people
  who only see him as a weapon?*"
"*Sometimes your way with words is too twisted for me to follow,*"
 Thalia complained.
 "*The professional facet of my personality tells me to shut up
   until we have a solid plan.*"
"*At least he understands the value of life.*"
"*That's true.*"
"*Except they draw the line at sentient species,
  because they do munch on lizards like--*"
"*They only eat flies!*"
"*Has anybody seen these flies?*"
"*Ugh, back at what you said before.
  Keep in mind he's... Newt. Not exactly an exemplary lizard citizen.*"

Dmytro Ivanovich started exchanging weird looks with Irakli Kosmovich.
A round or two of them later, they nodded and stood up in sync.
Grip tensed up, but they just passed each other and exchanged seats;
Derevyashko immediately addressed Lisa in English,
while Irakli Kosmovich took his time to reach the couch.
"*I can't agree more, Grip,*" he finally grunted, sitting down.
"*With what?*"
"*With the 'why is it always like this' part in particular.*"
"*And what would you do?*"
"*Sure not the putting sentient into sentient part. That's... abhorrent.
  I hope we can't pull this off yet,
  and it'd be awful if Newt turned out to be a missing link or something.
  Never bought into the 'somebody has to invent the nuke' argument...
  I'm so proud of you, kids. If you need help hiding him, I'm in,*" he winked.
"*Haha, there's no--*",
 Thalia forgot she was mid-phrase and jumped to the edge of the couch.
 "Mary!"
"What?" the other side turned their heads.
"Can you copy him by tomorrow evening?"
"Are you kidding me?! I don't even know what I'm freezing!"
"Overnight?"
"You wanna get him killed?"
"*See, no need to play hide and seek.*"
"No pressure whatsoever," Maria remarked to her clique's amusement.
"*But that also means we're not bringing his copy tomorrow,*" Thalia continued.
"*Yeah--*"
"*You can give him to me.*"
Unexpected Stalina standing so close made Grip jolt in surprise.
"*You?! Why would I give him to you?!*"
"*... Because I'm the only one who can guarantee that nobody else gets him?*"
 she replied in an eerily calm voice.
"*I'm not. Giving him. To you.*"
 Grip made a poor attempt at mimicking her intonation.
"*As you say,*" she turned and joined the other side.

"*Wow,*" Irakli Kosmovich summarized disapprovingly.
"*I'm not giving him to her,*" Grip repeated, shaken.
 "*I don't know what she expected.*"
"*I know where Maria keeps her lizard freeze,*" Thalia said in a bland voice.
 "*Should I? Snatch it to slow them down.*"
"*Yeah. Rather yes than no.*"
"*Can I talk to him?*" Irakli Kosmovich gestured towards Newt.
"*Yeah, why not.*"
"*Formally speaking, I sure cannot. You're the only ones authorized to.*
Grip turned to Thalia.
"*You can sure watch us talk.
  As for writing something yourself, only when I'm watching.
  And you need to be at least Grip level of tactful.*"
Grip giggled, tactlessly shaking the cage again:
"*We could use some help with a cloning agreement*", he suggested.
"*Cloning agreement?*" Thalia squinted at him.
"*Something to sign before he gets cloned.*"
"*Have you signed any-- wa-ait, we've got a save point tonight!*"
"*Really?*"
"*Yeah, so, let's scan you, so he sees it's not scary--*"
"*--Wait, why--*"
"*--be right back.*"

She jumped off the couch and headed to the other group, then stood behind them.

"*I'd rather see you defuse the situation, not stir up more trouble,*"
for the lack of the other troublemaker, Irakli Kosmovich addressed Grip.
"*Then they should calm down with these ideas--*"
He kept staring at Thalia, so she abruptly glanced sideways,
and disappeared faster than Grip scanned the room for Stalina
and understood he was fooled.
"*You might've missed that in the heat of the moment, but Lisa has a point.
  Nobody's taking Newt from you by force--*"
"*--which is curious--*
"*--and keeping it civil is in your best interest. Do you agree?*"
"*Yes. Why scan me again? I'm freshly minted--*"
"*Nah, she's right: one day you were alright, one day you were out,
  and one day was today,*" Irakli Kosmovich counted on his fingers.
Grip nodded:
"*At least I won't retake algebra.*"
"*Heh. Just my luck. I study dead and endangered languages all my life,
  now we find aliens, and you come back claiming
  just eleven native speakers remain,*"
  Irakli Kosmovich complained.
 "*But there's a silver lining to it.
   If there's just eleven, they must be ancient, if not immortal.*"
"*I suppose.*"
"*Like, centuries of living in a tightly woven collective.
  Maybe we can learn a useful thing from them for a change:
  how to live to two hundred without going bonkers?*"
"*Huh?*"
"*Something our powers that be would love to hear about.
  Do you know how old Svobodin is? He was already there when I was born.*"
"*That'd require us to take interest
  in something else than hurting each other for a minute,*"
 Grip replied bitterly.

"*So, what do we do?*" Derevyashko raised his voice.
"*Wait, where's Thalia?*" Stalina asked Grip.
"*She doesn't report to me,*" he lowered his head and pulled out his phone.
"*We need you both scanned today. Especially with this thing onboard.*"
Grip sent Thalia three question marks.
Stalina left the canteen, and, less than ten seconds later, Thalia returned,
hopped back on the couch and checked the phone.
"*We need to explain freezing to him,*" Grip addressed her.
She nodded back.
"*So, when they freeze me, make sure he understands we need to freeze him,
  not his lizard-- No, I don't know how, that's the question.
  He needs to understand that he must hold still,
  and that he needs it to get...*"
Both got distracted by Irakli Kosmovich moving his finger along the glass
for Newt to follow.
"*Don't worry, I'll come up with something,*" Thalia finally spoke.
 "*And I'll watch him while you'll be out.*"
"*And I'll watch Stalina watch you,*" Irakli Kosmovich joked.
"*... watch him watch me. Everybody, watch out,*" Grip declared.
"*Breathe easy. They can't copy him yet. They're not ready.
  And by the way, where's Stalina?*"
"*Looking for you!*"

"Here you are", Stalina entered the room.
"Finally!" Dmytro Ivanovich didn't go into who's looking for whom.
 "So, what do we do? Scan twice?"
"No," Thalia insisted.
"Pack up and fly away," Grip said, looking at his boss.
 "I like this idea more and more."
"I'm OK with that," he nodded.
"But I want to help them. You're solving the wrong problem,"
 Grip addressed Maria.
 "Can you fix their pro-- uh--"
"That also requires scanning him. And who knows what else," she winced.
"*Stalina Filantievna*..."
"*Huh?*"
"... you must have a protocol for everything.
 What's the protocol for a horrible secret?
 And don't tell me everybody just kills everybody."
"OK, I won't. But
 first you leave a warning, then minimize the chances of rediscovery."
"What? Can't be... that there's never been any...
 *mutual document destruction*."
"I've been told there is no such thing. Look, how would that work?
 We tell them we've erased everything, they tell us they have,
 then what? How do we check, how do we enforce that?"
"Destroy..." Grip was on the verge of panic.
"Destroy what? They can hide and exfiltrate it any way they want.
 Like, any sufficiently large chunk of data they transmit,
 they could be hiding the scan there."
"We're trapped," Thalia squeaked.
"--What do you--" Grip's voice faltered.
"Not yet," Derevyashko objected.
"Whatever you folks are up to," Irakli Kosmovich spoke slowly,
 "let me leave before you close the door."
"Nobody's closing anything," Maria spoke up. "They're just overreacting."
"You want to turn people into zombies, who will do what you--"
"--See!--"
Grip's knuckles went white again.
"--Don't be so dramatic,"
 Dmytro Ivanovich interjected.
 "We're not cartoon villains trying to turn people into zombies.
  As if there weren't cheaper ways to make people do what--"
"Like declaring them enemies of the state?" Thalia lashed out on him.
"Like depriving everyone of basic rights to sell those back to them,"
 Stalina smirked at her.
"How dare--"
"Oh cut the crap, both of you," Maria barked with disgust, scaring Lisa.
 "The last thing I need right now is your petty bickering."
"OK, I got it. We all need time to process it," Derevyashko nodded.
 "But I don't want to wrap it up on such a low point.
  Quick, give me something positive to top off the day."
"We haven't--" Thalia squeaked.
"--Ice cream--" Grip suggested to Maria, leaving no head unturned.
"Sorry, What?" Stalina's look was full of worry.
"He said positive. I know you have--" Grip addressed Maria again.
 "Ow! *What are you doing!*"
 he shielded his ribs from Thalia to Newt's upset rattling.
"OK! As you wish!" Maria snapped and stormed off.

"What's going on in here?" Derevyashko acted genuinely curious.
"Maria printed ice cream, and we ate it," Thalia admitted.
"Well, it sure is hot in here," he nodded, perplexed at the cost of this affair.
"You asked for something positive,"
 Grip insisted sheepishly as the silence dragged on.
 "I don't know what comes to your mind; for me, it's ice cream."
At least Stalina stopped looking at him as if he was losing it.

The room went quiet to follow Maria's hasty stride.
"Ice cream! Everybody gets ice cream!"
 she burst in with a nondescript container,
 attracting the audience's attention like a magnet.
 "You, the saviour of the humankind!...
  You, the lizard freeze thief!...
  You, the dissociate father figure!..."
"Sorry," Grip mouthed to Thalia, expecting another prod.
"... I only have two spoons though, so, please, come up with something."
"I'll get the glasses," Stalina was already rummaging through the cupboards.
"Mix it with food, you gotta to mix it with food, otherwise it's bland as ice,"
 Thalia hopped off the couch as everyone set into motion.
"And I'll go get some sleep now," Maria continued. "Before you--"
"Not so fast!" Thalia made her wince. "Save point!"
"... Then let's go?"
"No, I'm watching Newt watch Grip get scanned first!"
"Come! on!"
"Stalina!" Irakli Kosmovich was eager to share the joke.
 "I have my eyes on you having your eyes on her--"
Maria stretched out on the now-vacant couch with a heartfelt groan.

* * *

Newt crawled out of the jar and onto the sand
to demonstratively stretch out his tail.
"*I'm sorry, old pal,*" Grip mumbled at him compassionately.
Loudly stomping, Thalia returned with a small stack paper.
"Here!"
"Thank you!"
"Hey, leave me some."
"[do-show] | [signs']" Grip told Newt to write instead of rattling.
"[do-show] | [do-explain]"
"[I] [go] [object'] [be-complex]
|[you] [see] [I'] [go]"
 Grip wrote and pressed the paper against the glass.
Newt inspected it from an uncomfortably close distance.
"[exist] [you'] [be-new-?]" Newt didn't have much space to express himself.
"[object] [know] [I']
|[I] [go] [outside']"
Newt clicked again, and Grip yanked the paper back to elaborate:
"[you] [exist] [be-less-er] [I']
|[object] [exist] [be-many-er] [I']"
"[I] [exist-not] [be-less-er] [you']" Newt was nervous.
"[you] [can] [exist'] [be-many-?] [outside-in]"
 Grip wrote and changed his mind:
"[can] [exist'] [outside-in] [animal-of] [you']
|[be-many-?] [exist] [sun'] [exist-not] [sun']"
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] | [can-not] [exist'] [I']" Newt answered tersely.
"*Should I tell him to come out? For scanning,*" Grip asked Thalia.
She and Irakli Kosmovich were deep into drawing some scheme on a folded sheet.
"*Or is it more dangerous if he's outside, and he'll evaporate--*"
"*Ugh, stop it,*" Thalia cut him short. "*Not now. Leave it to Maria.*"
"[exist] [object-in] [be-complex] [I']
 [can-not] [go'] [object-in] [be-complex]" Grip wrote to little reaction.
"*OK, check this out!*"
"[I] [go] [object'] [be-complex]
|[you] [see] [I'] [go]" Grip showed to Newt again,
 while reading Thalia's chaotic diagram:
"[go] [object'] [be-complex] >
|[exist] [object-in] [be-complex] >
|[go-not] [object-in] [be-complex] >
|[object] [be-complex] [know] >
|[go-not] >
|[exist] [up-in] [sun'] >
|[go]"
"Excellent. Just what we needed."
Thalia circled the first column,
placed the folded sheet inside the jar and tapped it.
Newt crawled into the jar at a glacial pace,
as if he hoped that the kids would change their mind at any second.
"Go," Grip instructed him with the intonation of a tutor. "Let's do it already."
