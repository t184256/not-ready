Grip woke up to heavy boots stomping in the hallway.
He sprung up, hugging the massive blanket, and the stomping stopped.
Same room, New Amsterdam before dawn outside,
same portraits circling him inside. Creepy.

Grip dressed up quietly, looked into Svobodin's photo as if it was a mirror,
put his hair down with his hands, opened the door silently, peeked left,
peeked right, right up the barrel of a rifle...
"*Halt, who's that?*" the voice croaked a bit too late.
An utterly confused man in black uniform
stared at him from the dimly lit hallway.
"*I halt,*" Grip echoed.
"*Who in the world are you?*"
 The man removed the finger off the trigger and slowly lowered his gun.
"*I'm Grip, and who are you?*"
 Grip regained confidence, blood pumping in his head.
"*The one who stayed behind? What are you doing here?*"
"*Sleeping. I'd like to stay here, yes,*" Grip chuckled nervously.
 "*Ideally, not forever.*"
"*Yikes, I'm sorry, kiddo,*" he exhaled. "*You startled me.*"
"*I? Startled you?*"
"*I expected you to be taller.*"
"*Taller?... I mean, were I taller, you'd shoot me on sight?...
  But I was not, so it was inconvenient?*"
The rifle owner wasn't in the mood for jokes.
"*Hey, you were heading somewhere, weren't you? How about you keep going.*"
Grip didn't argue and rushed to the restroom with twice his former enthusiasm.

"*Good morning,*" he bowed, without looking, to the old man at the table.
The man raised his eyes from his notebook and squinted at Grip rushing past.
And on Grip's way back, he became even more interested in the kid.
"*What are you doing over there?*"
he asked him as soon as he crossed the doorway.
"*Washing,*" Grip didn't follow.
"*No, why are you sneaking in the guest wing at night?*"
"*Sleeping?*"
"*Come here, young lad.*"
No, Svobodin wasn't an old man yet. Elderly? Isn't it the same thing?
Much older than portraits.
Slightly older than photos. Definitely younger than Irakli Kosmovich.
"*You're not Maksimka,*" he ruled.
"*Mmm, I'm not,*" Grip agreed. "*I'm Grip--*"
"*Whose are you like this?*" the secretary general said something confusing.
 "*Voronov's?*"
"*No, I'm Stavropolskiy--*"
"*Sure. Voronov's?*"
"*How can I be Voronov's? He has a daughter.*"
"*What daughter, what daughter, when it has always been sons?*"
 Svobodin lowered his head and Grip stepped back.
 "*Don't mess with me, I remember everyone. No, not Friedrich and Engels...
   Carl and Martin, right!*"
 he straightened back.
 "*Look at'him, arguing with me...
   The nerve of this one...
   Hey, Stavropolskiy, aren't you that brat who closed a Fist planet?*"
"*Yeah, that one--*"
"*See! And you said you weren't Voronov's.
  Attaboy. How you did them fists...*"
"*How... did I do them fists?*"
"*Like this,*" Svobodin flicked him on his nose, and he laughed out of surprise.
 "*Just like this, an entire planet, together with the lizards.
   That's our man.
   How many heroes out there, their names no longer fit in here.*"
Time and time again, it was unclear whom does the secretary general talk with.
"*Are you here because of us?*"
"*No, no. Diplomatic horseplay, you know, work.
  Come over here, see for yourself, real dog work.
  Today we're erasing Sokolovskiy.*"
He opened the notebook again and raised the eraser.
Grip scanned the table: no, there was no pencil in sight.
The corner of the notebook was marked "II. 156",
the sheets were covered in faint text
in Russian cursive so chaotic, Grip couldn't make out a thing.
He bent forward, leaning on the table.
"*And what are we looking at?*"
"*The Book of Fate, duh!*"
He smudged the eraser against the word that did indeed look like "Sokolovskiy",
or at least, started with an "S" and featured a "y".
The word became two smudges fainter, remaining about as visible as before,
but Ilya Ilyich was clearly satisfied with the result,
already searching for the next occurrence.
"*There once was a Sokolovskiy, now there is no Sokolovskiy.*"
"*Harsh,*" Grip noted.
"*But just,*" Svobodin echoed. "*All right, why am I boring--*"

And that's when the table failed Grip, as it started rumbling towards
the secretary general. Instinctively, Grip managed to do the only right thing:
fall a little to the same direction, catch the moment, when the table
stops sliding, carefully push himself away and stand straight before
the assassin speeding at him downs him on the spot.
A bald teen, his skin as grey as the walls before dawn,
stopped right before Grip, exhaled into his hair and pulled the table
back in place.
"*Stasik, why are you so jumpy today?*"
 Ilya Ilyich scolded his guard. The guard paid zero attention to the scolding.
 "*We were just chatting.*"
"*Live another day,*" Stasik addressed Grip from a hair away.
 "*Svobodin said you're free to go.*"
"*Have a nice day,*" Grip retreated to the stairs.

He ran upstairs and hid behind his old friend with an assault rifle.
"*What's up down there?*"
"*I need Marek,*" Grip panted.
"*Pertsev? Marek Istmatovich? Easy as pie.
  Don't you know, he hears everyone!*"
"*So what?*"
"*I don't know. Summon him three times,*" he half-joked. "*What if it works.*"
"*Marek Istmatovich. Marek Istmatovich. Marek Istmatovich,*"
 Grip repeated and opened his eyes.
No dice. Grip walked further down the hallway, returned.
"*Maybe he's still asleep?*" the man shrugged. "*Wait some more.*"
"*Oh, I forgot about the book,*" Grip sighed and headed back to his room.
 "*I'll sit here, OK?*"
"*Why not.*"

Marek didn't come. Grip didn't want to venture downstairs again.
About half an hour later he heard the heavy steps wandering off.
He waited a bit more and peeked outside. No one around.
"*Marek Istmatovich. Marek Istmatovich. Marek Istmatovich,*"
 Grip repeated.
 "*Ollie ollie oxen free.*"
Before he turned into the hall, Grip hid behind the corner once again.
Slowly peeked and observed the walls. No one in sight.
He went to the centre of the room, to the windows, checked behind the curtain,
looked behind once again, peeked outside.
The crowd has evaporated, the street was open to cars again,
the Institute of hybrid law enforcement stood across the street.
Grip kept looking and found two weirdos to the right of the gates
that he definitely didn't want to run into.
"*Marek Istmatovich. Marek Istmatovich--*"
Approaching steps. Lora-Laura hastily entered the room with a phone in her hand.
"*Marek is busy, and he has an offer for you.*"
"*Eh?*"
"*You take this phone, and you don't come back until tomorrow.*"
"*A phone, a book and two comic books,*" Grip immediately started bargaining.
"*What book?*"
"*Irakli Kosmovich should've left one for me,*" Grip turned and saw it.
"*That one? No, I'm not telling him this,*" Lora change the subject abruptly.
"*What?*"
"*None of your business.
  A phone, a book and you don't set your foot in this house today. Now.*"

Grip grabbed the phone, dashed for the book and ran, happy,
straight for the front door.
He avoided the two on the right by turning left right away
and sprinting as fast as he could, then taking another left,
until he found some microscopic park.
He then jumped over the shrubs, sat at a bench and exhaled:
"Free the kids!"

The book had a crossword, the crossword featured an address at the top:
"Farnborough 114/216 Institute of applied linguistics, Farah Strong".
Grip checked out the phone and got stuck in the interface
for almost half an hour.
It was kind of intuitive, yet everything was wrong.
Took him just a second to learn he has a staggering total of
five point zero zero zero grams to his name.
And an eternity to reach the deepest corner of the settings to learn that
his name today was Anton Novoseltsev.
Marking the embassy and Farah's address on the map: just a couple of minutes.
Learning he's in Highborough, and how huge is that Highborough thing,
and that Farnborough, fortunately, neighboured that Highborough
--- ten more minutes.
Thalia must also be in this Highborough thing.

The dawn broke in the meantime.
A mom with a pram went past, a toddler followed her.
Some runner passed in the background.
But cars, cars were already queueing up to spend their day in traffic.
Grip liked running away from his problems,
so he decided against taking the subway;
after all, reaching that Farnborough on foot seemed plausible.
But first he needs food. Why can't you just hop every day?
It wasn't nice the first time, on Arkadia, but otherwise Grip loved hopping.

Food was very clustered here.
Ten more minutes later, after filtering the ggggg and gggg places off the map,
Grip arrived at a conclusion that canteens just don't exist on New Amsterdam
altogether.
The closest thing to a canteen he could find was quite off route,
so he was doubly disappointed when he arrived at the place, and the pavement
just ceased to exist. With no visible entrance and no plausible way to reach it
anyway, he set off for the next one, slightly worried about its picture
featuring just two chairs and a table occupying half the pavement.
But that one had pavement!

Indeed, there it was. Two chairs, a table, a menu,
and a tiny window in the wall too high for him to peek inside.
Grip found the familiar words from yesterday on the menu.
"Hello?" he knocked, and the window opened.
 "I'd like a burger and a bottle of Frizzings, please."
"You're not from 'round here, are you?" a voice rumbled above his head.
"No, I'm not."
"A Fed?"
"Yeah."
"Just so you know, that thing's sweet."
"I know, thank you. Where do I pay here?"
"You can hand the phone to me, and I'll handle it for you."
"I'd rather not," Grip held his phone tighter.
"Smart boy. Tap the menu, read carefully and confirm twice."

A staggering two hundred milligrams poorer, Grip sat at the flimsy table and
bit into his burger. Probably not one of those his boss was so impressed with.
An old lady passed by, and Grip made out her blabbering:
"--handsome in his uniform, such a self-sufficient fellow, dining here alone,
 all by himself--"
For a second, he considered chasing her to share
his achievements for the past week-- or a month, rather? --but
the politeness and the language barrier prevailed.
"*Self-sufficient, alright. I bought food, and I ate it, all by myself.
  So handsome. Out-right-standing,*"
 he kept mumbling in between the bites.

The border between Highborough and Farnborough couldn't be more clear,
and not because of the interchange: Farnborough was the high-rise one.
And, high above its grandeur, was the rain cloud heading from the bay,
which, initially, didn't concern Grip.
But as soon as the first, warning drops of water
reminded him how does the rain work,
Grip suddenly realized how utterly water-permeable
he was in his Rosario school uniform and with a paper book to boot.
He hid in an unmarked transparent booth along the way.
Now the occasional passers-by unconcerned with the upcoming rain gawked at him,
their faces so puzzled, that Grip began to doubt his plan.
He waited for the street light to turn green
and dashed for the trees two blocks away.
OK, rather, a single majestic tree, one that counts as an entire park.
A tall young woman on the bench under the tree put her phone aside
and cheered and rooted for Grip's almost dry arrival.

"Woo-hoo, you made it!" she announced out loud.
"I made what?" Grip rammed into the other side of the bench.
"Made it here, all dry!"
"Ah, haha, yeah. Hello!"
"I'm Lisa!"
"I'm Grip!"
"What are you doing under my tree, Grip?"
 she butchered his name beyond recognition.
"Is it your tree?" Grip turned to check it out. "It's wonderful--"
"No," she laughed, "but I come here so often,
 I grew to pretend that I'm the spirit of this tree."
"That's cool!" Grip liked the idea. Lisa was cut out for the tree spirit job.
 "Nice tree, spirit! Nice spirit, tree!"
"Thank you," she laughed for a little more.
 "But you just make it sound like I need a real hobby."
"Let's find you a hobby. What do you like to do?
 Except coming here to be a spirit?"
"I don't know..."
"I think walking is a hobby. Already."
"Yeah, everybody's driving these days...
 I've heard that, back on Earth, we used to be hunters,
 and we outwalked our prey to death, mile after mile.
 Sounds so metal. But I don't think walking is a hobby, is it?"
"Why not? If you walk hard, it becomes a sport, right? So, why not a hobby?"
"Dunno... But look, if I don't think it's a hobby,
 then it means it's not gonna-- I mean, at least for me..."
"OK, what would you like to do right now?"
"Right after my night shift? Lie down and cease to think."
"If that means you're tired, then you need to do something with your brain."
"Like what?" she snorted. "Like education?"
"Could be just singing something. While walking here. Or back."
"That sounds so weird."
"Or learning poems."
"That sounds even weirder," she giggled.
"Only if you do it aloud! If you do it in your head, it's not."
"Well..."

The rain poured down, so they had to raise their voices.
"And what are you doing here? Where are your parents?"
"On another planet! I'm travelling without them."
"Oh, really?" she was surprised and worried.
 "So you're a traveller? Have you seen the Gates already?"
"Not yet. What is it?"
"Are you sure you're a tourist?"
"I'm not a tourist, I'm an explorer," Grip hugged the book tighter.
"An explorer, huh? That sounds so old-school. So, how do you find Amster?"
"Wet."
Lisa laughed out loud.

"That's one... astute observation. Where else have you been?"
"I've been to four planets--" Grip counted.
"Wow!"
Grip swallowed the "--this month" he had at the tip of his tongue.
"I should've travelled when I was little!" Lisa exclaimed.
 "... OK, that is mighty impressive of you, young explorer.
  And these are your travel notes?"
Grip opened the book in the middle towards her.
"Yikes! You can actually read that?"
"Yes, I can!"
"And write it?"
"You bet," Grip shone like a diamond.
"Take this thing away from me," she shook her head.
"You wanted a hobby, right? You can try lizard!
 It's simple, actually. There's not a lot of words, and they connect with--"
"No-no-no, don't even think about it. Have some mercy.
 Back when they tried to cram Russian into my skull,
 it just broke something and fell out,
 but this, this is something else entirely.
 I mean, look at this thing, how does one even read that?"
"That's the thing!" Grip put the book aside and raised his finger.
 "Yesterday-- I learned that everybody reads them differently!
  Turns out-- I mean-- there are at least three wrong ways to do it,
  and only one of my friends does it right!
  Now I also want to learn the right way."
The pieces finally started to fall into place for Lisa.
"Wait a minute," she looked at him, as if she saw Grip anew.
 "You're an explorer."
"Correct," Grip nodded with a sinking feeling.
"And you're studying their language. To go there--"
Seeing all these emotions parade across Grip's face,
Lisa realized she must've said something terribly wrong:
"Oh no! I'm so sorry! I forgot they closed their-- I--
 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-- I'm sure you'll find a way to visit it!"
