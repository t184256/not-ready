Grip had a headache and didn't want to wake up.
When he gave up, moved and opened his eyes,
he saw some creep towering aside.
"*Get up, agent*!" somebody cheered out loud.
 "*Your first hop is over, Grip, so, from now on, you've got nothing to fear.*"
Somebody other than the looming gloomy man, as his lips weren't moving.
He was, though. He approached Grip, looked him in the eye and stated:
"*Shot you up with some garbage, eh. Does your head hurt?
  Get up, stand on one leg.*"

Grip shoved the blanket aside and immediately curled up from the chill.
His body didn't follow through the movements the right way,
and there was some unfamiliar lightness to his body.
He sat up, shivering,
noticed the second man by the door,
stood up clumsily, stretched his arms out and lifted one leg.
"*You're gonna be alright. Gonna hurt for a while, yeah, but that'll subside.*"

Grip sat back and wrapped himself in a blanket.
One thing that did not subside was the awkward lightness.
"*So, eh, you're one healthy young fella, not sick at all,
  I got almost nothing to fix about you,*"
  the gloomy man spoke to Grip rapidly.
  "*Strengthened the bones, cleaned the teeth, extracted the stones,
    just the standard stuff. You won't notice a thing. Stay healthy.*"
  the man turned to the door.
    "*That's it, he's yours,*" and left without further ado.
There was something odd about his gait.

"*Glad to meet you, Grip Avdotievich, and welcome to Arkadia!*"
Grip stopped following the leaving man
and turned his attention to the other one:
young, tall guy, similar gait.
"*I'm gonna be your boss.
  Name's Dmytro Ivanovich. Dmytro Ivanovich Derevyashko,*"
  he introduced himself in a friendly tone and sat down next to Grip.
"*Hello.*"
Grip averted his eyes to inspect this ridiculously cold suit of his.
No threads, no seams --- expensive, printed.
"*That'd be your work suit, as I understand.
  It's hot on Epsilon Indi 3, so you'll wear this.
  Hang in there, we'll try on a few more.*"
Grip followed his gesture with his eyes.
The night stand featured Grip's well-worn bag, stacks of clothes
and four glass shots.
Dmytro Ivanovich handed him another suit, a heavier, much denser one,
with a transparent full-face hood.
"*Here, grab that suit--
  nah, on top of this one, you're gonna wear one over another.
  Now walk around, squat --- is it alright? Too tight, maybe?*"
He noticed Grip's clumsiness and went on with:
"*Yeah, our gravity's lower, so you'll be a superman for a while.
  Don't get too used to it though,
  the lizards have it closer to yours.*"
Grip found nothing to complain about, and didn't know where to look for.
"*Great! Your next one would be printed a size smaller then.
  OK, cut it, put on your stuff,*" he said, as he started to unpack the bag.
"*And this one is?*" Grip asked, pointing at a tidy stack of blue fabric,
  and started to change into his regular clothes.
  Clothes very similar to his regular clothes.
"*Dress uniform,*" Derevyashko replied.
  "*You can skip that one. Everybody has it, but it's not really needed.
    Come back for the award ceremony, then you'll make use of it.*"
"*What's this, huh?*"
  Grip found a small plastic bag and put it against the light.
  The bag looked empty.
"*Kidney stones,*" Derevyashko found that funny. "*Printed separately.
  Means your water ain't that great over there.*"
"*What for?*" Grip was puzzled.
  There were, indeed, small specks in the corner of the bag.
"*Like, they're part of you. We're supposed to hand them to you.
  Makes no sense to print them inside your kidneys.*"
"*No, why spend energy and print them at all?*"
"*Oh, the Federation sure hasn't gone broke on them micrograms.
  I mean, you can barely see them,*" Dmytro Ivanovich reasoned.
"*And what am I supposed to do with them?*" Grip stayed perplexed.
"*I'll dispose of that,*"
  Derevyashko smiled and took the bag away.

Grip grabbed a phone, a new one, not a scratch on it,
and found himself looking at the news for a minute.
Life was much more intense over here, everything was unusually vivid,
and it seemed like there were more convents, gatherings and meetings
every hour than Rosario had in a month.
Dmytro Ivanovich waited patiently, clearly interested in the four shots.
When Grip was about to put the phone down, he's gestured to hand it over,
opened the contact list and handed the phone back.
All the contacts were greyed out, but the topmost one:
 "*Derevyashko Dmytro Ivanovich*".
"*Here's mine, just in case. Go on, tell mom you're fine.*"
There was no "call" button across her entry, so Grip sent a message:
 "*Hopped fine, stones are no longer in the kidneys,
   congratulate me on my first boss.*"

Derevyashko smiled supportively and almost proceeded to ask about the shots,
but Grip carefully approached the window, drew the curtains open,
effortlessly pulled himself up the windowsill and took a look outside.

Almost every single thing looked oddly unfamiliar.
It was snowing --- a concept Grip was familiar with, in theory.
The houses stretched upwards, the street below was brightly lit
and full of people walking, gliding, moving around...
Were he at the very top or a couple of floors below,
the view could be worthy of a New Year card.
From here though, neither the skyline nor the people looked their best.
The second time in... no idea how much time
Grip remembered the solidarity day from the two years ago.
Maybe, viewed from above, solidarity day was the same.
Except that there people were moving in an organized way, and here they...
just scattered around.

"*Is today some kind of holiday?*"
"*What?*"
  Derevyashko also approached the window.
  "*No, it's always like this here.
    Don't be shy, ask questions, it's OK that you're a bit disoriented.*"
"*Why is everyone walking their kids then?*"

Now it was Dmytro Ivanovich who was disoriented.
He clearly didn't understand the question at first,
then went deep into thinking, then started formulating the answer.
Meanwhile, Grip realized one of the teens isn't gliding on the road itself,
but rather hovering on some board of sorts.
His eyes followed her as she was getting away.

"*Well, here's the thing, Grip,*" Derevyashko began.
  "*You're from a mining planet, aren't you?*"
"*Yeah, I am,*" Grip agreed with that unusual, but apt description.
"*So, yours is a frontier planet, a less comfortable one,
  and you all work hard for the Federation's common good.
  And the professions are more menial,
  I mean, I don't mean like you're mining uranium with a pickaxe there,
  I mean, fixing machinery, hauling said uranium,
  cooking food, washing streets...*"
Grip was nodding along, even though he didn't know what "pickaxe" meant
and no one washed their streets.
But dad used to fix robots, so that ringed true.
"*And here it's different, almost no factories around,
  we don't really produce tangible stuff.
  Not much to do around here with your hands.
  People are rather, y'know, scientists, civil servants, writers, engineers,
  creative folk.
  No shifts, no brigades, six hours workday whenever they like it the most,
  for example, three hours in the morning and three in the evening.*"
"*That sounds unfair,*" Grip was rather hostile about the idea.
"*And the rest is usually spent with kids, to rest,*"
  Dmytro Ivanovich wrapped it up and prepared to argue.
"*To rest? With kids?*" Grip mocked him.
"*Oh, as a supervisor to a couple dozens of kids,
  I do understand your scepticism,*" Derevyashko smiled wide.
  "*Let's not make it about myself though, I don't work for six hours either.
    See, when you aren't working with your hands,
    your rest is markedly different.
    Say, you're sitting late in the office,
    scrambling to find a billion extra nails in Omega for six hours straight,
    when you've got thirty billion ones extra, all in some other systems.
    If I force you to stay for two more hours,
    these nails aren't gonna materialize themselves,
    unless you come up with something unconventional.
    But, on the other hand, if I let you go now,
    you'll gonna think about them on your commute, at home during the dinner,
    or worse, the nails are gonna haunt you at night.
    Now, this is something kids are great at helping with.*"

Having somewhat clarified
the grand total of one difference between their planets,
Grip returned to the night stand and started packing.
"*Why are there four shots? I've asked for just two.*"
"*We weren't sure whether you want normal ones or printed ones.
  These are printed, these are cast.*"
Grip has brought the shots together.
The clinking of the printed ones was better.
He then promptly stowed them in a bag,
leaving Dmytro Ivanovich without the explanations.
Instead of asking, he checked his watch.
It was so old-fashioned, that shiny bracelet worn on a wrist.
Who wears watches these days? Is it a spy gadget?
Why make a spy gadget so shiny and noticeable?

"*Alright, let's go?*"
"*Wait. Will you tell me what am I supposed to do?*"
"*Let's get you enlisted first.*"
"*Fine. Where are we going?*"
"*Means we're going to work,*" Derevyashko half-evaded the question.

Walking wasn't hard, just required some focus.
They left the room, spiralled down the staircase
of this large institution
packed with relaxed people of wildly varying appearance
and busy personnel donning white coats,
left the building ("*hold on, put on a coat*")
and merged into the foot traffic, one more adult with a kid.
Grip tried to look everywhere at once,
soaking up impressions just to dilute them down with newer ones,
then blend them together into a single incomprehensible mixture.
The most memorable one was, probably, the trees
smack in between some houses,
with no purpose, no barrier, no visible function.
Derevyashko picked up a call, Grip worked on his walking skills,
trying to keep up and stick to smaller jumps at the same time,
passing a tree after a tree
left out there in the cold, snowcapped, forsaken.

Finally, they've stopped in front of another indistinguishable building.
Dmytro Ivanovich shook the snow off their coats,
and they entered yet another public institution:
large staircase, long hallways,
people greeting Derevyashko with brief phrases or subtle gestures.
Is this Grip's workplace now?
Suddenly Dmytro Ivanovich stopped in his tracks between two doors,
brightened up, listened for a while, bent down and whispered to Grip:
"*The first impression is the most important one.
  Spies, diplomats, they all need style. Listen.*"
And sneaked cartoonishly towards a closed door,
stopped in front of it, one hand on the knob,
another one in Grip's way.
Grip listened as hard as he could:
"*...late night.
  No result, zero, it's all set, yet we can't stop watching them.
  Got nothing on the partner as well.
  So, I'm like, screw it, I'm off to bed.
  As soon as I drift off -- a flash:
  'The new agent has ordered two shots, approve synthesis.'*"
A quiet drawl was the answer. The voice continued:
"*Uh-huh, what would they ever do without me?
  Anyway, I groan and reply with one eye open: 'Approved. Is he here?'.
  'Not yet'. I fall back to sleep, and then, in the morning, it dawns on me!
  The new agent, not yet --- must be Derevyashko's agent!*"
Muffled laughter.
"*What kind of a kid is that--*"
(Dmytro Ivanovich unblocked the way and put his hand on Grip's shoulder...)
"*--who's not even here yet--*"
(... softly opened the door and pushed Grip inside ...)
"*--but has already ordered two shots...*"
The speaker has noticed Grip and trailed off.
"*Allow me to introduce myself: Grip Avdotievich Stavropolskiy.*"
The redhead in the back of the room buried his face in the hands,
but failed to conceal his laughter.
The speaker started chuckling, standing in place, leaning on a table.
Derevyashko, content with his escapade, slipped past to one of the workspaces.

"*Hello, hello,*" the closer man finished chuckling.
  He was older than the redhead one and looked quite likeable.
  "*I'm Aksat Dzhonatanovich.*"
"*I'm Grip.*"
"*You've told that already, don't spoil the impression,*"
  advised the redhead instead of introducing himself.
  "*How's your head?*"
"*Fine, thank you.*"
Derevyashko was writing something on his phone,
the redhead fished out a large paper book.
"*The rules say you must swear an oath,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich said,
  "*But then the other rules say you can't, because you're not eighteen yet.*"
"*Stupid rules, if you ask me,*" Derevyashko interjected.
  "*Like, you're too young, and we can't trust you no matter what. Bollocks.*"
"*So just sign over here,*" the redhead finished, pointing at a book.
"*... What if I don't have a signature yet?*"
"*You can write down your name.*"
"*Can I practice first?*"

Practicing took time.
Grip never learned to write in Russian cursive.
But he knew well how to draw lizard signs,
so he settled on capital "*STA*" and a [be-proper] sign,
one formerly known as "good".

"*Congrats on enlisting,*" the redhead said and closed the book.
"*Now, will you tell me what am I supposed to do?*"
"*No,*" Derevyashko stated plainly.
  "*I really hope they'll tell you on arrival.
    What I can tell you though, is what your goals are.*"
"*And what are they?*"
"*You're going on a joint mission with the Fist.
  Your utmost priority is establishing and maintaining
  diplomatic relationships with those lizards.
  Put simply, make friends with them. Our kids -- their kids.
  Now, the Fist are cunning bunch, they'll capitalize on anything
  they can lay their hands on, lizards included.
  It'd be wonderful if we ended up as lizards' best friends.
  Say, you convince them to leave the planet, check out how people live.
  Do your best to make sure it's our teleport the lizard is going in,
  not theirs. Give it a tour of Arkadia, for example.
  But, fists being fists, it's the relationships with lizards
  that are your top priority.
  Am I clear? Retell that back to me.*"
"*Loud and clear.
  Friendship with people comes first, Federation specifically --- second.
  Invite lizards to us.*"
"*Attaboy. The mission itself ain't secret, cause it's a joint one,
  but what exactly happens there still is.
  You'll have to write daily reports,
  and, once you're back, we can leisurely decide what to declassify.
  And that's it.*"
"*That's not enough. How do I meet them? How do we befriend them?*"
"*As if I knew. Sorry, I'm not the one to help with that.
  Never seen a lizard, never learned their language.
  There should either be a joint briefing... or one on arrival.*"
Grip wanted more, but Dmytro Ivanovich spread his hands preemptively.

"*And the second agent?*"
"*We don't know who. But you'll meet soon.*"

"*Why me-- No, don't get started about the essay.
  Aren't there some special people to handle this?
  There are people for everything--*"
"*Like, contactees?*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich snorted.
"*Who?*"
"*The Institute of Contact,*" he elaborated.
"*Their days are numbered, mark my words,*" the redhead commented offhandedly.
  "*They'll close it.*"
"*Calm down, Nostradamus,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich snorted again.
"*Gentlemen,*" Grip slotted in.
"*Alright,*" Derevyashko took the lead.
  "*Indeed, there are special people for the job.
    They, uh, messed up.*"
"*How?*"
"*You see, people were worried that we'll bump into aliens,
  for quite some time, even before the expanse.
  And it makes perfect sense that
  the better the aliens are at space-faring,
  the higher are the chances we'd run into each other.
  We agreed that when it happens,
  we'd better come prepared, and thus the Institute of Contact was born.
  So that, when the day comes, we'll waste no time on the nuances of alienese
  and cut straight to the part where we're begging them to spare us.*"
"*And we met lizards,*" Grip nodded.
"*And we met lizards,*"
"*I see... But can we...*" Grip trailed off.
"*We can what?*"
"*No, nothing... OK, if not them, why intelligence services?
  Why not diplomats? Don't they want to?*"
"*Oh sure they do, but who's gonna let them,*" Dmytro Ivanovich muttered.
  "*It just happened that it's the military's domain, historically.*"
"*We're sibling departments anyway,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich added.
  "*We're not starting a war with lizards that can't even go to space.
    If that's what you're asking about.*"
"*The Fist claims it's their diplomats who are handling the lizards,*"
  the redhead noted.
"*Oh, we can also claim whatever we want,*" Aksat Dzhonatanovich chuckled.
  "*In actuality, everybody's gonna send agents anyway.*"

"*What did you need these shots for?*" the redhead changed the topic.
"*To rattle like lizards,*" Grip spilled the beans at last.
"*O-oh,*" the redhead intoned with respect.
Aksat Dzhonatanovich, on the other hand,
was left displeased, or at least pretended to.
"*Should've told us right away what you're after,*" he said in a stern voice.
  "*Maybe we could've come up with something better.
    And now it's probably too late...*"

Zulfiia Solkovna entered the room, waited for him to finish the phrase,
pinned Grip in place with her eyes and commanded jokingly:
"*Everybody out, boys!*"
The three men begrudgingly followed her order.

Grip knew her, he talked to her twice to date.
Once when his dad was taken, and once again, a week later.
Maria Stepanovna asked him to stay after class,
then Zulfiia Solkovna came in, and they discussed some rather abstract topics.
First time they've constructed different scenarios
in order to discuss what was or was not just.
The scenarios have invariably converged at a conclusion
that one must first determine who's in charge and then aid them.
The second time it seemed like she was trying to determine
which careers Grip was predisposed to.
Grip has gladly partaken in the discussions about different kinds of jobs,
but what was the goal, if any, was a mystery to him.
Both times she has divulged nothing specific
about the topic that mattered --- his father.
And both times Grip came back home to unmistakable signs of searches,
so, maybe what they have talked about wasn't important after all.

The third time has carried on the legacy of the first two
when it comes to awkwardness.
Zulfiia Solkovna tried to behave like an old acquaintance of his,
but something was off.
They didn't beat around the bush for too long:
"*Say, Grip, what do you think about the Fist?*"

Grip hasn't really thought much about the Fist, he never saw any.
He sifted through his memory and recalled a recent conversation with mom.
Grip was insisting that if he were to invent a better excavator bucket,
it'd be fair if everyone who benefitted from it paid him for that.
Mom has convincingly countered that, at a timescale of a century,
his bucket will help almost everyone in the universe, even if just a little.
And thus, looking back a century, Grip will also end up indebted
to pretty much everyone, so accounting for all of that is outright infeasible.
Yeah, and along the way, she has mentioned in passing
that fists have something like that, but even then it's not really like that.
None of this has helped Grip answer the question,
so the silence dragged on.

"*Uh... they're people, just like us.
  They live on their planets, we live on ours.
  Space is big, so we don't interfere with each other.*"
"*That's right, but what's the difference then?*"
"*They don't believe in the common good,*" Grip remembered the official cliche.
Zulfiia Solkovna was content with the correct answer,
yet she also looked like she wanted for more.
She also stopped her usual constant jotting down.
"*They have their own, different state, built differently.
  Ilya Ilyich Svobodin is not the head of them,
  they've got some other ones...*"
The incessant jotting down has resumed.
"*The mission is going to take place at their base, did you know that?*"
"*Because they were the first to discover the lizards?*"
"*Yes. There is just one base there, their ship.
  Half of the personnel will be from the Fist,
  and so will be your partner.
  What do you think about that?*"
"*I don't know,*" Grip didn't have any reservations against the fists
  and didn't understand what was required from him.
  "*But we all want to be friends with the lizards, us and them alike.*"
"*When this will be over, and you'll make friends with the lizards,
  would you like to go visit them?*"
"*Visit Fist?*" Grip felt the need to clarify.
"*Yes.*"
"*I don't know. Probably yes. Should be... interesting.*"
  Grip answered after a pause.
  "*Which language will we speak?*"
"*With fists?*" It was her turn to clarify now. "*English.*"
And she went on to reassure:
"*You've been learning it for five years already, you'll manage just fine.
  If you don't understand something, just ask and they'll explain again.
  It's a joint mission after all.*"
Grip wasn't that sure of his English skills.
But then he remembered he's now an ambassador to lizards or something,
so maybe this particular language barrier
really isn't the top problem on his list.
"*A-and we're done,*"
  Zulfiia Solkovna finished checking all the checkmarks
  or whatever she was doing over there and stood up hastily.
  "*I won't delay you any further.*"
For a split second Grip was sure that it wasn't her,
but someone else, her twin sister he never met before.
But he couldn't pinpoint why.
She cheered him up with something vacuous,
and opened the door to reveal Dmytro Ivanovich waiting outside.
He entered the room, but showed no intention to settle here for long:
"*Let's go get some food! We've got a plenty of time and I had no lunch yet.
  To the canteen!*"
Grip was all for it.

They went outside again, only to stop by the next door.
Grip only got time to ask:
"*Is it a problem, working with the fists?*"
"*Depends. To me -- yes, you don't even imagine.
  To you -- not at all, like I've said.
  Make friends with lizards first, deal with the fists later.*"
"*I'll have to speak to the fists in English.*"
"*See, how convenient it is then,*"
  Derevyashko refused to acknowledge his concerns,
  "*that you happen to know it.*"
And dove into the canteen, putting this discussion to an end.

Grip was dazzled by all the bright food.
Tens, if not hundreds of different dishes,
unusually colourful, mostly unfamiliar.
The other worries had to yield to choice paralysis,
but, with Dmytro Ivanovich's help,
Grip settled on something only moderately cryptic.
Derevyashko picked up not one, not two, but three dishes,
and they occupied a smaller table.
Grip's food, especially the bright red thing,
turned out more colourful than tasty, yet passable overall.
When he was done with it, Dmytro Ivanovich was still mid-second dish.

"*Does Zulfiia Solkovna have a sister?*"
"*Huh?*" Derevyashko uttered nonchalantly.
"*What is she doing here?*"
"*Gauging your psychological fitness for the job.
  It's nothing to worry about, just a standard procedure,
  every agent undergoes that.*"
Grip squinted at him:
"*Every one of your agents
  gets interviewed by our school's psychologist?*"
"*Ah,*" Dmytro Ivanovich understood the question,
  but was in no rush to explain anything.
  He first weighted some pros and cons, and only then lowered his voice:
  "*Some people, Grip, usually outstanding experts in their fields...
    They're allowed to live on several planets at once.*"
"*At once? Like, copied?*"
Derevyashko raised an eyebrow:
"*How do you think you came here?*"
Grip didn't answer.
"*So we scanned you there and printed you here.
  You were erased over there though, and they were let to live.
  But only on different planets.*"
"*Only on different?.. Can't we just make copies of them right here?*"
"*Of course we can, technically,*" Dmytro Ivanovich smiled.
  "*Except, uh, how does one put it...
    People, almost all of them are... at odds with themselves, you know?
    It's better if they never meet.*"
"*I get it,*" Grip smiled back.
  "*I'd also rather not... But why destroy me?*"
Derevyashko didn't get the question,
yet proceeded with his prepared reply nonetheless:
"*First, that requires a permit... Uhh... What for?*"
"*So that it's easier for mom.*"
"*Ah,*" Derevyashko understood but disagreed.
  "*That way we, uh, gonna face a big problem, Grip. An ethical one.*"
"*Ethical?*"
"*Moral. You see, if both of you get to live separate lives,
  you become different people, and then it's gonna be murder.
  Picture that: they talk, they walk, they make memories together,
  he goes to school... And then what?
  You come back, with no memories of those walks and studies,
  and we kill the other you? That's inhumane.*"
"*So let him live, and kill this me instead.*"
"*Oh bother,*" Derevyashko gasped.
  "*That's even better. So, you work hard, you establish relationships,
    you return a hero, an invaluable expert with a lizard on your shoulder...
    And then what?
    We fend off the journalists, bring you to a dark corner, award
    and kill you? Just brilliant.
    I've got an even better idea:
    let's rather stick to not killing anyone, OK?*"
"*So, the way it is now is not killing anyone?*"
"*Who said that? Or, here you are, alive and well,*"
  Dmytro Ivanovich parried with conviction.
"*And you claim you've erased me there, and I'm the only one?*"
"*Just as I've said, yes. There's no second you.
  People don't get duplicated left and right, Grip,
  not without a permit, pre-agreement and all that headache.
  There have to be some solid reasons.*"
"*As you say,*" Grip worked at concealing his disbelief.
  "*Can we have a secret phrase?
    One I can send, so that you know it's time to save me?*"
"*Sure,*" Derevyashko agreed readily. "*Like what?*"
"*'Blue snow',*" Grip suggested.
"*Well, if you want to, but shouldn't it be inconspicuous?
  Something you can easily work into a report.*"
"*Alright, then...*" Grip thought for a while. "*'I miss ice cream'*".
"*Deal. Try not to write that on accident though.
  I see it, I hop over to save you, or send someone better.*"
"*Good. Where's the restroom?*"

After washing his hands, Grip has examined himself in a mirror.
The reflection was clearly of him wearing his ordinary clothes.
A copy of the clothes. A copy of him.
Still, the oddest thing was the low gravity.

Derevyashko was done with his meal.
"*We still got a couple of hours to spare, what are we gonna do?
  We can walk along the river, fly in a park...*"
"*No idea,*" Grip insisted.
  "*Zero. It's my first day here, and I know absolutely nothing.*"
"*Let's have a ride then, if Mit'ka lends you a board.*"

This time they went to an almost normal apartment block.
That Mit'ka boy handed them a board without saying a word,
and they set off to a park.
"*Just after you've strengthened your bones! But anyway, try not to fall!*"
  Dmytro Ivanovich admonished him.
  "*Gonna turn on educational mode*", "*don't fly high*",
  "*if you fall, aim for the snow*" and "*try to avoid flying into anyone*"
  bombarded Grip, as he tried to take all of them into account at once.
Standing on a board turned out to be the easy part.
It didn't fly higher than a meter, and neither did it accelerate too fast.
Turning was simple and intuitive;
the bit that required practice
was not moving in all directions at once.
But that was manageable as well, so Grip has almost figured it out.
He even flew around the park without falling or hitting anyone,
ending up expectedly pleased.
After checking his watch yet another time,
Derevyashko hurried up.
They returned the board and headed for the Palace of Reconnaissance,
happy and red-cheeked.

The Palace of Reconnaissance turned out to be a real place,
and quite some grandiose marble place it was.
It stood high like the Rosario administration,
its steep steps partly occupied by the kids.
A group of teens was singing, three younger kids were repairing a board.
The entrance was branded with a face of Ilya Ilyich Svobodin,
his side-view being easily thrice the Grip's height.
They entered a huge hall with sky-high ceilings,
and joined Aksat Dzhonatanovich on a bench nearby.
The hall was mostly empty, but lively;
people walked past, chatted on the benches.

Derevyashko was looking straight ahead, waiting for something.
Then checked his watch again, muttered "*Where are they?*",
and the very same second two people entered the hall from the opposite side,
and adult and a kid with two short pigtails.
They kept holding hands for several more steps, but then
the kid broke free and sprang into a frontal assault,
each giant leap modulating her war cry:
"*De-rev-ya-a-a-a-shka-a-a-a!*"
Derevyashko sprang up, extended his hands in a greeting
and commenced an interception manoeuvre
to the following commentary from Aksat Dzhonatanovich:
"*No, no, no, no... o-of*".

Dmytro Ivanovich caught and lifted the girl off the ground:
"*Thal'ka! You parasite! Look how you've grown up!
  Last time you were what, half the size, and
  babbling something about diplomatic immunity...*"
That greeting made the girl shift into reverse and signal to lower her down,
yet her squealing stayed friendly and cheerful:
"*How are you, how's Maksimka doing?*"
"*Awesome, wonderful! How are you?*"

Grip stood up and approached the scene;
Aksat Dzhonatanovich followed and began the introductions:
"*So, here we have Martin Aleksandrovich Voronov, a defector.*"
The girl's companion looked Grip in the eyes and nodded from afar.
"*And this is Thalia, your partner, an excellent agent.
  Good acquaintance of Derevyashko since the times he was catching her.*"
"*And caught her twice!*" Derevyashko added, well-pleased.
  "*Once in the archive, and then once again in the council's office.*"
"*Thalia, this is Grip, your partner.*"

Skinny, loose-limbed, energetic Thalia calmed down a little to inspect Grip.
"*Where are you from?*"
"*Rosario.*"
"*Ever been to Kronnitsa?*"
"*Nope,*" Grip replied. "*Only to Rosario and, since today, here.*"
"*Are you good at lizard?*" she kept on interrogating him.
"*People keep telling me I'm good at writing,
  but I'd rather wait and see what lizards think about it.*"

Thalia's attention got diverted to Derevyashko.
Grip also looked at him. Dmytro Ivanovich shamelessly enjoyed the show.
"*Lieutenant! Pitting a* valenok[^2] *against me? Are you serious?*"
"*Thalia!*" Derevyashko, smiling wide, pretended to be offended.
  "*First of all, it's *valenok*, the stress falls on the first syllable.
    Second, if you know about my son, you know about the promotion as well.
    Third, it's impolite, for he's no felt boot, he's your partner!
    And, finally, he's your partner. Sort it out yourself.*"
Thalia looked humiliated, working on suppressing her emotions.
Aksat Dzhonatanovich stepped forward, but she stopped him with a glance,
breathed in, breathed out and stretched her hand out:
"*Listen, let's start anew. We were off to a bad start.
  Helga Thalia Voronov. Friends call me Thalia.*"
Grip shook her hand eagerly and smiled:
"*And I'm Grip Avdotievich Stavropolskiy. Friends can call me '*valenok*'."*
Thalia has twitched a little.
Grip interpreted that as a suppressed attempt to hit him with her left hand.
Aksat Dzhonatanovich groaned disapprovingly, Derevyashko was having fun,
Thalia's father observed the fuss condescendingly,
as if the drama was unfolding in a sandbox.
And there was some woman with a tablet approaching them.
She noticed Grip looking at her,
stopped right where she was and loudly proclaimed:
"*Grip Stavropolskiy, Helga Voronov, follow me to the press room!*"
"*Bummer,*" Dmytro Ivanovich uttered.
  He saw Grip's questioning look and elaborated:
  "*That means we're not hearing anything useful here. Only there.*"
Aksat Dzhonatanovich quietly, yet legibly remarked,
addressing no one in particular:
"*Look at the bright side.
  At least she won't leech our blood over here.*"

[^2]: A soft felt boot. Not a compliment.

Thalia was striding away; Grip tried to catch up and almost succeeded.
The press room could fit, like, three hundred people,
but there were just three: two with mics and a woman with a tablet.
She escorted them to the centre and said:
"*Go ahead.*"
"*Where to?*" Grip asked.
"*Tell us about your mission,*"
  one of the journalists stretched his mic towards him.

Grip hesitated. Thalia looked at Grip expectantly.
"*We're heading to Epsilon Indi 3,*" Grip began slowly,
  "*to the first extraterrestrial intelligence we've ever met.
    We're excited that humans are not alone in the universe.
    Lizards and us have much to learn about each other,
    and I hope we'll make good friends with them...
    our kids-- us, with them.*"
"We are honoured to represent the humanity,"
 Thalia picked it up confidently,
 "in such an important intercivilizational mission.
  And we are confident that it will mark a new beginning
  of a wonderful intercultural collaboration."
The journalists, satisfied with what they heard,
roamed away. Thalia made a beeline to the exit, Grip followed her:
"And why are you so sure everything will be wonderful?"
"Cause otherwise they won't release this video," Thalia brushed him off.
"Huh."

Their escort was waiting in the hall,
but the woman with a tablet displayed no intentions of stopping
and headed left to some hallway:
"*This way, agents.*"
Thalia waved at her dad, Derevyashko waved at her,
in the end everyone waved at everyone else
and the kids disappeared into the hallway.
From there they turned left into a room with multiple stalls.
The tablet woman sent Grip into one of them,
and, half a minute later, a large guy in white joined him.
"*Just arrived, huh?*"
"*Uh-huh.*"
"*Just look at what they're doing, huh. No shame, no conscience.*"

The man looked Grip into the eye, whipped out a syringe.
"*Any last instructions?*"
"*No,*" Grip hesitated nervously.
"*Wishes?*"
"*No.*"
The man lowered the hand back.
"*Hey, is everything alright?*"
"*Physically? Yeah, I'm fine.*"
"*Well, that's the only thing that matters to me,*"
  the man said with a smile, as he performed an injection.
