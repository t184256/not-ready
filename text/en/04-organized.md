Turning in bed came to an abrupt end
once the pencil poked Grip between the ribs.
In retrospect, placing it on the bed was a terrible idea.

The footboard was adorned with another thermal suit.
Grip's phone blinked downwards demandingly on the bedside table.

Yesterday's
"*Agent, report.*"
"*Situation normal. Your agent. Sleep.*"
grew a slightly less laconic:
"*Outta your mind? A report to me, hi to mom. Now.*"

Grip yawned and elaborated:
"*There will be a second contact. There is a new word.
  Obtained permission to demonstrate several objects.
  Negotiations are carried out with a totally new alien,
  who has never talked to humans before.*"

There was also a "you didn't look great last night, please come for a checkup"
from Maria and an audio from mom.
Mom has sent some very generic words
on how proud she is and how she misses him already.
She didn't sound overly worried, more like, feeling down in general.
Grip decided against disclosing anything specific about the mission,
only what he feels about it;
and concluded with a request to tell him more about her and her life.

OK, now, Maria. Grip's mouth was dry, he was hungry.
Wait, did he eat anything yesterday?
No surprise tha--

A phone rang right in his hand. Dan:
"Morning, colleague.
 Listen, the system isn't ideal here, I mean,
 I don't see what you're sending and where. Just the size of it.
 Also means I have no idea what's urgent and what can wait.
 So, please, when you send something urgent,
 drop me a message shortly afterwards.
 This way I'll know it should go out right away, OK?
"Sure. The first one was a report, so I guess you should--"
"A report, you say?" Dan chuckled. "OK, I'll send it right away. See ya--"
"Wait, and... about the other one. How often do you send them?"
"You mean, batched ones? These will go out with the next batch, so
 could be up to 8 hours of delay if you're particularly unlucky with timing."
"Thank you!"
 Grip was, once again falling prey to that exhausting mode of operation,
 when he grasped the general sense,
 but only a fraction of the words making it up.
 Yet there was, seemingly, nothing worth clarifying.
 "The second one can wait."
"Got you, and sorry for the hassle. The system, y'know."
"Yeah-yeah, no problem."

So. Checkup. Maria. Where is that?
Grip couldn't navigate the fist half of the base.
"Where should I go?" he wrote, changed his clothes and read the answer:
"Come to the teleports."
Cool. Can do.

At the last crossing, Maria called him through a door frame.
Turns out her room was right here,
just a flimsy separator wall away from the teleports...
Not a room, a study. A lab, even.
Screens with some graphs and drawings, translucent... tableware?..
with unidentifiable stuff inside.
And a small boring fridge by the entrance,
one thing Grip could identify with absolute certainty.
The equipment looked more electronic than biomedical to Grip,
there were even wires in one of the table corners.
The room looked like neither an operating room, nor a doctor's office;
there wasn't even a second chair, let alone a sofa.

"Hi, thanks for coming."
"Hello. Is there something wrong with me?"
"I don't know-- I should mention upfront, I'm not a doctor --I just don't like
 how you looked last night. You were fine at first,
 then suddenly got all pale and tired."
"But..." Grip fumbled.
 "It's normal, isn't it? To be tired after... teleporting."
"No, it's not," Maria shook her head.
 "You're supposed to feel great post-hop.
  Well-rested, satiated... not hungry,"
 she rephrased after seeing Grip frown.
She sent a long thoughtful look across the room, but,
before Grip could follow it, addressed him again:
"Anyway, come with me, let's not make it awkward with the hand scanner."

They returned to the teleports, where Maria opened the lid of the closest one,
and made an inviting gesture with her hand.
The lid looked rather heavy,
adorned with shiny mechanisms hanging downwards from it.
Grip climbed in awkwardly, laid on his back and asked:
"Should I stop breathing?"
"Please don't stop breathing," Maria answered with a straight face.
 "I'm no doctor, but that doesn't sound healthy at all."
Her phone rang.
"Yeah and no matter what's happening, don't touch the moving parts."
And then, into the phone:
"Hi, Lee!.. Nope, I'm not planning to...
 It's just a medical scan... no-no, a quick one... bye-bye!"
She closed the lid, leaving Grip alone in a dimly-lit box,
with the said moving parts set in motion immediately, right above his face.
The hard bottom of the box and something else moving almost out of his sight
haven't helped him feel any comfortable.

Meanwhile, voices started screaming outside.
Someone shouted at Maria, Maria defended herself.
Suddenly everything went quiet, the movement has stopped, and the lid went up.
Stalina Filantievna hoisted Grip onto her shoulder unceremoniously,
then, immediately, carefully put him down on the floor.
"As you can see for yourself, he definitely is not!" Maria argued.
"What in the world, how dare you even think you're cleared for this?"
Stalina Filantievna walked up to her menacingly.
Without a clear overarching context,
the individual words no longer clicked together.
"Snap out of it, what are you implying?
 Before you make a fool out of yourself,
 what exactly are you planning to incriminate?"
Stalina Filantievna didn't wait for her to finish,
and the resulting mash was no longer even segmentable into words.

Grip looked around, disoriented,
and noticed Thalia observing the scene from where they came from,
listening carefully, two colourful tubes in her hand.
She caught his glance and waved at him.
As Grip approached Thalia, she was stepping back absentmindedly,
until she lured him into the lab, around the fridge and into the corner.
There she sat on the floor,
listening to the commotion through the separator.

"*What's going on?*" Grip whispered, sitting down next to her.
"*Maria put you into our scanner,*"
 Thalia glanced across him briefly, focused on the other conversation.
"*So?*"
She looked at him quizzingly.
"*Uh, nothing, I guess,*" she replied.
 "*You're not paralysed, what...*"
  she paused again to parse the concurrent speech behind the separator.
  "*... what is she gonna do? Make Grip-shaped steaks?*"
"*... ... a photo should be enough to make a steak...*" Grip speculated.
"*But the taste? It just won't be... Shush,*"
 she raised her palm in a stopping gesture.

The voices stopped, replaced with energetic steps.
Stalina Filantievna and Maria are leaving? Coming here?
Probably, that's what Thalia is figuring out as well.
No, not here. To the canteen?

Thalia relaxed and conspired:
"*Would you like some ice cream?*"
"*You bet!*" Grip's morale soared.
Not only he was hungry;
Epsilon Indi 3 climate lent itself perfectly to ice cream.

Thalia smiled wide, put the tubes aside and flicked her wrist demonstratively.
Two long spoons appeared out of nowhere, spinning between her fingers
before getting handed to Grip.
Then she opened the fridge to produce a glass container out of it,
flashing a menacing pile of sticker-laden syringes for a split second.
Thalia then took one of the spoons back
to split the ice cream roughly in two halves.
Grip wasted no time tasting his.
"*So bland.*"
"*How ungrateful of you,*"
 she parried with mock indignation and grabbed the tubes.
 "*Pick your poison.*"
Grip chose the one with the orange cap.
Attachment, possibly, that's a bit too large for a cap.
Thalia took the blue one and squeezed it out onto her half.

"*That's the stuff.*"
Mixed with the orange-flavoured goo, the ice cream turned delicious.
Grip stuffed his face excitedly, Thalia mostly kept up.
"*Lick the spoon good,*" she instructed, as he scooped the last solid chunk.
"*So that you can collect my biological material? Gonna clone me?*"
"*Don't wanna stain my suit, stupid.*"
"*Sorry,*" Grip backtracked. "*Thank you for the ice cream.*"
Placing the container back to the fridge
offered Grip another brief glance at the syringe pile.
The closest sticker said "Maria".
Spoons were then spun back into oblivion with another flick of a wrist.

"*Let's go, we've got a lot to cover.*"
"*Got what?*" Grip caught up to her.
"*Like, order everything you've promised to bring yesterday?
  And come up with at least some semblance of a plan.
  And you, obviously, didn't write your reports.
  And we should probably show the new signs to Irakli.*"
"*And I should also find some time to study,*" Grip muttered absentmindedly.
 "*Hope they've calmed down already.*"
He finished that sentence and stopped to listen.
As it was evident from over here, they haven't entirely calmed down.

"*Why-- If you say it's no big deal, why are they still upset about it?*"
Thalia found the question funny:
"*Adults...*", she waved her hands around vaguely, gathering words,
 "*Just like kids, you know. Go make them do their jobs.*"
"*Me?*"
"*Why, who's a diplomat, you or them?
  We're a contact group, like, a diplomatic corps.
  So, that'd make them service personnel to us, they're here to help us,*"
 Thalia dispensed these ideas bit-by-bit,
 giving Grip's world view ample time to turn on its head.
 "*And what they're doing now ain't helping.*"
The voice from the canteen became unusually monotonous,
as if Stalina Filantievna started dictating something.
"*So, show them who's the boss and make them cut this nonsense,*"
 Thalia concluded,
 all without Grip finding a single weak link in her reasoning.
The voices got more emotional again. Grip hesitated.

"*Haven't you learned at least some style?*" Thalia wondered.
"*Learned what?*" Grip snapped out of thinking.
"*How to maintain composure. Put on a face. Ah, whatever.
  Just be confident,
  like you're the adult here, and they're just kids quarrelling.
  Bring it on,*" Thalia concluded and dragged him towards the canteen.

Grip remembered his first lesson on style,
but couldn't figure out how was that applicable now.
They've marched to the canteen, Grip scrambled for words,
then started listening to Maria's quiet counterargument, but too late
("--played by the letter and the spirit of the joint--"? what?),
as Thalia, a sly fox, fell two steps behind at the last moment,
turning their entrance into his entrance.
Well, telling her what he thinks of her would be out of style.

"Crew!" Grip barked, interrupting Maria.
She, Lisa, Stalina Filantievna, Irakli Kosmovich sitting aloof --- everyone
stared at him.
"What are you doing here, why aren't you working!" he continued.
 "Our next meeting with lizards is in, what, 9 hours,
  and we've got a lot of work to do!
  Stalina! Start with printing us a glowing stick."
"Aye!" Stalina affirmed indistinctly without changing her pose.
Irakli grunted approvingly, well-pleased, the rest watched Grip
with a growing interest.
"Maria!" Grip turned.
 "Let's go, we need you to draw animals.
  Irakli Kosmovich, I'll visit you later today."
Maria stood up slowly and went out.
Grip turned around to follow her, but Thalia fell behind again for a second
before catching up.
"*And why do you fall behind?*"
"*Shook a finger at them,*" Thalia reported.
Grip let out a long sigh.

"What do you mean: 'draw animals'?" Maria asked, confused.
"That was-- I told you yesterday, Newt has expressed an interest in animals,
 and we've promised him we'll bring pictures--
 He calls those 'schemes'," Thalia began to explain.
"Newt?" Grip frowned.
"Yeah, yeah, I know, I just can't resist--" she made a grimace.
"Thalia..." Maria interjected.
"--he calls himself 'new', and newts are some kind of lizards."
"Newts are not lizards, newts are salamanders,"
 Maria objected,
 "and your friend over there is neither!
  Also, since you're clearly not listening,
  so I'll try to get through to Grip instead.
  It's a bad idea to call him... it... a name it didn't pick itself!
  How would you like him calling you names they choose?"
"... they'll have to choose names for us if they want to call us something."
"Yeah," Thalia backed him. "They can't call us our names anyway."
"That's not what I meant. What if he doesn't like his."
"Why wouldn't he?" Thalia wondered. "When he calls himself 'new'."
"Who knows. What if they find real newts ugly?
 Also, why do you think it's a 'he'?" Maria finished triumphantly.
"He... no idea..." she trailed off, befuddled.

Once Maria sat down, she got bombarded with conflicting requirements.
Took a while for her to understand the contact group
wanted schematic drawings of various small animals
with a lizard thrown in for scale,
plus tables of animals' parameters for the reference.
The selection of said animals proved to be the hardest part.

"A chicken!"
"Ooh! Yeah! And a hen! And an egg! All together, same picture.
 Lizards do lay eggs, don't they?"
"No. They absolutely don't. They give live birth to little lizards.
 Are you still sure you want a chicken?"
"Yes!"
"As you say... but that means, we're dropping something else."
"Growlick?"
"No, not the growlick!"

A three-in-one chicken, a hare and a fly made it to the top three list,
but, at the last moment, Grip insisted on an amoeba as well.
Maria corrected their wild ideas on biology with incessant pedantry,
and already started putting up a collage of a hen, a chick, an egg
and a half-transparent lizard.

"When will they be ready?" Grip asked.
"Let me see... Give me five, maybe three hours.
 I'm a biologist, not an illustrator."
"Oh! We also need to print that other stuff."
"Go ahead, I'll find you later," Thalia decided to stay behind.
"Wait-wait-wait, just a minute,"
 Maria opened something else, colourful and blurry,
 then scrolled through a long list of numbers for a while.
 "I don't have a complete scan, but it's clear anyway you're dehydrated.
  Don't let that suit fool you, it's hot here, even inside,
  so you sweat a lot. Meaning you need to drink much more water.
  You know where to get water, don't you?"
"Yes, I understand, I will drink more."

Stalina Filantievna intercepted Grip on his way to find her.
"*What were you even thinking about, crawling into their scanner!*"
 she uttered, joining him in the long hallway to the canteen.
"*Sorry, what's the problem?*"
"*Maria-- the Fist would be able to print you!*"
"*... and learn all our secrets, uh-huh.
  What kind of federal secrets I know that Thalia doesn't?*"
"*None whatsoever,*" she argued not.
"*And there's nothing special about me myself.*"
"*As you say.*"
"*So?*"
"*So?! The ability to print someone exerts a lot of power over them.
  Just think about it later.*"
"*But they can't print me, can they?*"
"*No, they cannot,*" she admitted reluctantly.
"*And you can.*"
"*I can.*"
"*So, that ship has sailed.*"
"*There's us and there's Fist. Never ever set foot in their scanner again.*"
"*Understood. As you say.*"

They found themselves standing in the canteen.
"*You wanted to print something,*" she reminded, handing him a glow stick.
Grip snapped it, engulfed it with his hand, observed the light.
At least that was better than nothing.
"*Is it dangerous for lizards? If one wants to bite it, I mean.*"
"*When you don't know for sure, always assume it is.*"
"*I want more of these. At least one each day.*"
"*Sure, I'll print some more.*"
"*Thanks, but that's not all. A magnifying glass.*"
"*Just don't burn anyone with it, OK?*"
"*We're meeting at dusk.*"
"*With a handle or without one?*"
"*Without one, I mean, a small one.*"
She pulled a phone out of her pocket, fiddled with it briefly,
lowered it, so that Grip can see the screen:
"*Like this?*"
"*Uh... is it a small one?*"
"*About this large.*"
"*Make it half the size. Good. Now something rechargeable, fluorescent...*"
Interior decoration catalogue offered a white-ish star.
"*This one, perfect! And I also need a water bottle.*"
"*Sure thing...*"
She started scrolling through pictures of bottles really fast.
Grip has noticed some motion on the periphery,
but he was too busy with the carousel of--
"*This one-- one step back --just like I have at home.
  Maria told me to drink more.*"
"*By the way, were you planning to feed him?*" Thalia asked mockingly.

They both turned to the table.
Thalia avoided eye contact by immediately drinking from a glass,
but this tactic had an obvious downside:
she couldn't drink forever,
and had to lower it eventually and proceed:
"*Relax, I fed him an orange one already.
  By the way, Grip, they're in that drawer over there.*"
Grip grabbed a blue-tipped tube, and tasted its content.
Without the ice cream, it wasn't nearly that great.
Stalina Filantievna just observed her with an expressionless face,
until Thalia felt uncomfortable and changed the subject:
"*Stali-ina Filantievna-a, print us a ball.*"
Grip's phone ticked.
"*Should I also print you goals?*" she parried calmly.
"*There must be some category for that.*"
"*There is none.*"
"*Come on, ple-ease...*"
Besides the "I've got a sample for you to check" from Maria,
there was a missed one from the chief:
 "*Write so that if you die, the next one can read it and continue the work.*"
 Grip shivered.
"*I said 'no'.*"
"*Maria has something to show us,*" Grip addressed Thalia.

A "preview" they've collected out of the teleport
turned out to be the first picture they've ordered.
Maria accepted corrections, asked questions about the next ones,
then decided to give them a short and boring lecture on the scarce local life.
Not-lizards aside, it amounted to not-cacti growing here and there
plus some flying not-insects symbiotic to them.
None of the two really needed not-lizards, who, in turn,
gleefully snacked on them both.
The microscopic life was much more diverse,
but Grip didn't understand most of that and found the rest yawn-inducing.

The knowledge fountain almost dried up, when Thalia commented, out of the blue:
"Maria thinks the lizards aren't sentient."
Maria's hand jerked involuntarily,
leaving her to blankly stare
at the lizard's claw on the picture obscuring the entirety of amoeba.
She then turned around to lecture Thalia back with reinvigorated enthusiasm:
"No! Are you a diplomat or what?"
"*She's a provocator, that's who she is,*" Grip remarked with condemnation.
Maria's agreement was so strong at the moment,
the language barrier meant nothing to her.
"First!" she nodded furiously. "Let's set it straight,"
 "First of all, don't you dare say that to them!
  They're clearly sentient, what I'm saying is, I don't see why would they be,"
  she cooled off gradually.
 "Their brains are not that large, and, perhaps more importantly,
  I don't see what evolutionary benefit would that bring.
  The lifestyle they lead, it doesn't force them to collaborate...
  or compete, even.
  Nor invent tools, nor solve complex puzzles.
  But they do talk, they have a culture of their own,
  so, clearly, I'd be in the wrong if I ever claimed that.
  They are sentient. I just don't know why."
Grip braced himself for a "second", but, somehow, there was no "second".
So he thanked Maria for her help, and dragged Thalia away, just in case.

Irakli Kosmovich waited for them:
"*Hello,*" they greeted him in unison.
"*Hello-hello, boss,*" Irakli singled Grip out.
 "*That's one stern talk you gave'em.*"
"*Well, why couldn't they--*"
"*You're right,*" he toned down the mockery.
 "*A mountain out of a molehill. As if it was something--
   wait, don't, don't sit down on the floor, you sprout.
   Go find another chair or, I don't know, sit on the table.*"
Irakli Kosmovich moved a stack of papers
and Thalia hopped onto the corner of the table.
Grip opted to stand.
"*I didn't know lizards write so fancy.
  Upside down, in columns, their tail working both sides as they walk...*"
"*Oh yeah,*" Irakli nodded apologetically.
 "*That's not something your courses feature.
   All because we were forced to hammer
   their writing into European typesetting practices
   stemming from what, 15th century?
   On the other hand, imagine we dumped all of that on you at once,
   and forced you to write upside down in joint...
   Anyway, you're good? Have you figured it all out?*"
"*Yeah, we have. I've brought new signs.*"
"*That's great, let me see... I know this one, it's a 'plan' or a 'scheme'.
  Works figuratively as well, by the way. Does that match up?
  With the usage you've observed.*"
"*It does,*" Grip agreed with a trace of disappointment.
  "*May be 'picture' as well. And this one must be 'water'.*"
"*Uh-nah, can't be water. Fellas don't even have water.*"
"*What could it be then?*" Thalia asked.
"*Tah-tah-tah... It's a seldom used one,
  I'm not sure whether we have this one figured out...
  I had it somewhere over here, give me some-- yeah, must be in this one...*"
He dug deep into his papers, got lost,
tried one from each of the stacks in the front row,
one from the stack behind Thalia,
brightened up, grabbed some more...
"*Here, yes!*"
Grip recognized the tale from his studying materials.
Except here it featured an extra sign:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[we] [be-tired] [?#2?-in]
|[we] [want] [eat']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

"*Yeah, that doesn't quite fit...*" he had to admit. "*Could it be figurative?*"
"*Nothing is off the table. Ask them.*"
"*We already had,*"
 Thalia was timid and respectful,
 as if she ran out of her troublemaking steam for today.
"*And?*"
"*And he said he can't explain it, and he has to think this through.*"
"*He said it's inexplicable,*" Grip corrected her.
"*Well, he'd better think about it,*" Irakli Kosmovich shrugged.
  "*For I don't know.*"
"*Do lizards sweat?*" Grip wondered.
"*Do lizards... sweat? I don't know.
  I don't recall them saying anything that'd suggest--*"
"*Let's just ask Maria,*" Thalia reached for the phone.

"*Why have you omitted the sign? From the tale, I mean.*"
"*A tale...* Irakli Kosmovich stretched out and smiled.
 "*That's cute.
   Because millions of pupils would ask hundreds of thousands of teachers
   what does it mean, and out of hundreds of thousands of them,
   there are almost zero who are fine with
   admitting they don't know the answer...
   But the tale,*" he stressed the word,
 "*was too good to just drop it altogether because of just one sign, wasn't it?
   And it's not like the meaning hinges on it or anything.*"

"*No, they don't sweat,*" Thalia informed them after a short silence.
"*How much white noise can you recall?*" Irakli Kosmovich asked her.
"*Two kilobits,*" Thalia replied, proud of herself.
Wide-eyed and frowning, Grip had no idea what was that about.
"*Attagirl, now that's what I call a spy! Two kilobits! No paper for you,*"
  he made an exaggerated protective gesture over one of the paper stacks.
"*Why would we both carry paper? I can borrow Grip's anytime.*"
"*That's true,*" Irakli Kosmovich conceded.

The topic seemed to be exhausted, and Grip started a new one:
"*Newt wants to learn our language.*"
"*Interesting,*"
 Irakli Kosmovich replied with a particular lack of interest in his voice.
 "*That's a nice name she came up with, isn't it?*"
"*And what do we do?*" Thalia asked.
"*And what have you tried?*" a spark of curiosity flashed in his eyes.
"*I wrote 'greetings',*" Grip admitted.
 "*He said that's 'too many signs, too many sounds'.*"
"*And I wrote 'hi',*" Thalia added smugly. "*He liked that one better.*"
Irakli Kosmovich just smiled without commenting.
"*So, what do we do now?*" Grip broke the silence.
"*Maintain this interest carefully.
  Teach him a few simple words--
  no sentences, no inflections, no conjunctions, no nothing;
  a handful of short words, single form only.
  If he'll still be interested, we'll see what to do then.
  But don't rush it.*"
"*We speak, he writes?*" Thalia clarified.
"*You write, he writes. I don't think he can make out our speech.*"
The disagreement took over Grip and Thalia:
"*Why would you say so!*"
"*No! He does! I think...*"
Irakli Kosmovich was unfazed by the sudden united front.
"*Well, see for yourself.*"
He took Grip's piece of paper and started jotting down
consonant pairs: "*b-p*", "*g-k*", "*z-s*"...
"*Don't get your hopes high. Consider this, just how likely would that be?
  They've got radically different phonetics,
  they just don't... have a use for telling our sounds apart...
  possibly not even the body parts required for that.
  I'd be surprised if Newt understands our speech one day.*"
"*Haven't you tried that already?*"
"*They have expressed no interest in learning our language before.*"
He ended the list with pairs of Russian vowels.
"*Thank you,*" Grip took the paper back.
  "*We'll see. I think he really is curious about it.*"
"*Good luck. To you and to him. Don't rush it, cherish that curiosity.*"
"*We'll try to,*" Thalia jumped down, and they left for Grip's room.

"*So, what's the plan?*" she asked once they got there.
"*Guess what, I still don't have a plan.*"
"*You know, I'm actually OK with how it's going.
  With you taking the lead and me on the sidelines.
  But we need to agree on some key points.
  I think that we should not ask him about them at all.*"
"*We shouldn't. I agree,*" Grip nodded.
 "*He wants to know more about us? Good, we give it to him.
   Show him these sounds, simple words, maybe, pictures, that's for sure.
   Can you pick up the pictures?*"
"*Sure. Otherwise, you won't even begin with the report, would you?*"
His sigh of martyrdom marked her unexpected exit.

Grip lay on the bed, facing his grim assignment at last.
Reflecting back, he simply had too much craziness to chronicle.
To get to the point quicker,
he decisively condensed everything preceding the contact itself to just:

> *I arrived.*

and then jumped straight to the contact.
It was unclear what was novel
and what has already been documented excessively over the last year.
It was also unclear whether the awkwardness of their first columns
posed any value to humanity.
And it was especially unclear
how to preserve all the ambivalence-laden misunderstandings of yesterday,
provided he's successfully forgotten
the exact wording of pretty much everything.
But then there was also the overwhelmingly good stuff
(he talked to an alien! it drank from his hand! the not-water sign!),
and it was steadily shaping into his longest essay ever.

One time he got interrupted by Stalina Filantievna,
who brought a magnifying glass, a star, more sticks and a water bottle.
Grip used that as an excuse to embark on a break.
Then, when he was deep into editing,
Thalia brought pictures, and he had to read the accompanying text.
When, at long last, he sent out his first report,
it was almost time to go gather material for the second one.

That day they left even earlier.
With the sun still above the horizon,
they sat in the centre of the dome, bored,
until another swarm of lizards swept across the desert.
As if captured by their stream, they ran on the sand
and then drifted a bit along the wall,
admiring the swarm from a much closer distance.
The distraction let Newt arrive unnoticed until the doors' went hissing.
He initially dashed towards the centre,
but altered his course after his first stop inside.
The second meeting was thus held on the sand, near the wall.

Once he got close, Newt dropped something down.
Grip carefully picked up the green, moist offering, with sand on the underside.
"Cactus! Juice! Cactus juice!" Thalia recognized it as well. "[be-?#2?-?]"
"[I] [think] | [I] [show]" Newt chittered and wrote towards her.
Grip carefully placed the gift on top of the water bottle cap,
diverting a surge of Newt's inexplicable, silent attention to the bottle.

Animal pictures were the first item on the agenda.
While, for example,
the "lizard for scale" concept required minimal explanations,
the hen-chick-egg trinity really threw a spanner in the works.
It proved difficult to convey
the idea of all three of them being the same animal, and the simple
@"[aforementioned] | [be-different-not]" didn't work out for some reason.
The lack of the transitions in the language and
a severely underdeveloped concept of 'age' only complicated the matters.
They didn't even have a sign for an egg, they just used an egg-shaped contour
--- that was quite a mess.
It was only when Grip drew a line
from an "[animal] [be-new]" to the "[animal] [be-new-not]",
and Newt augmented that with an egg,
forming a counter-clockwise egg-chick-hen-egg cycle to run around,
the gears in Newt's head got unstuck, and he seemed to internalize the concept.

To make the experience more varied, Grip demoed him a magnifying glass next.
He put the paper against the wall, wrote "[substance] [help] [see']" on it,
brought it to the sand and put a magnifying glass on top of the writing.
Newt then proved rather enthusiastic against moving the glass across the paper
with his front paws and nose,
sparing little attention to the optical properties of it.

Thalia proceeded with the rest of the animals.
Newt probed the hare picture with his nose, saying nothing;
calmly received the news of flies going "[sky-in]",
held a brief conversation on the topic of their edibility;
then somehow took an issue with amoebas' existence:
"[animal] [be-small] | [exist-not] [purpose']" he insisted.
Thalia put that picture away, but Newt kept complaining:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [want-not] [see'] [schemes']
|[I] [want] [see'] [animals']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*And you're gotta get animals,*" Grip promised out loud.
"*What are you up to?*"
"*Not sure, I haven't fully decided yet.*"
"*And you're promising it already!*"

"[you] | [be-proper-?]" Newt wrote in the meantime, turned towards Thalia.
"Am I?" she wondered aloud.
"Who knows."
"[I] | [know-not]" she wrote back.
Newt ran in circles, calmed down, did not elaborate.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [want] [see'] [animals'] [yours-of]
|[I] [want] [see'] [living place'] [yours-of]"
"[you] [want] | [go'-?] [living place'-?]" Grip tried to clarify.
"[be-news-not] [know-not] | [we'] [go]" Newt wrote hastily instead of answering.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"Awesome," Thalia remarked dryly through pursed lips.

Grip didn't know what to do with this newfound headache of them,
so he went further with the plan: demoed the dimly glowing star.
Newt poked it the same way he explored every other object.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[I] [can-?] [hold'] | [object'] [be-sun] [be-danger-?]"
"[do-hold] | [do-eat-not]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Newt ran around with the star in its mouth,
while Grip massaged his temples.
That [hold] could potentially mean ownership,
if lizard possessives ever had anything to do with ownership.
Grip decided he's not taking it back.
"[be-hot-not] | [true]" Newt admitted after the running part.

They moved on to the glow stick,
another impressive [be-hot-not] object that made Newt put the star down.
It was fun, but hasn't entirely solved the reading in the dark problem,
as the glow stick did a better job glowing them into their eyes
than onto the tailwriting.
Covering it with a hand helped, but was not convenient at all.

OK, that was the last thing to show... Grip glanced at the bottle.
"[you] [explain] [juice'] | [I] [understand] [juice']"
 he wrote, now certain that [?#2?] means "juice".
Newt either didn't get it or just wasn't compelled to respond,
so Grip completed:
"[exist] [I-in] [juice']".
Another glance, no objection, no agreement, no response.
Time for a demo then!
"[do-see]" Grip wrote, rolled up his sleeve and placed the hand onto the sand.

Once sweat started rolling down, Newt outright panicked,
running around, rattling, staring at Grip, running again,
and then finally expressing it in writing:
"[do-show-not]"
"*Stop it, you're making him nervous,*" Thalia got worried as well.
"[exist-not] | [danger']" Grip tried to write with the other hand,
while Newt interfered, ran in front of the finger,
and, later, erased the first part, leaving just "[danger]".
"*Stop it,*" she insisted, so Grip sat straight and rolled the sleeve back.
Newt lay down and observed him motionlessly,
at least the part he could see without raising his head.
"*It's not gonna kill me!*"
"*I do know, yes. He doesn't.*"

Grip moved the bottle in front of Newt and tapped it,
making him stand up reluctantly and look him at the finger.
"[aforementioned] [be-juice] [sky-of]" Grip announced.
That led to running and a subsequent denial:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[exist-not] [juice'] [sky-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip tapped the previous writing again.
"[sky] | [be-substance-not]" Newt came up with a counter-argument.
"[sky] | [be-substance]" Thalia weighted in.
"[can] [hold'] [substance'] | [can-?] [hold'] [sky']"
 Newt had well-founded doubts.
"*Oh, I'm gonna show you it's material,*"
  Grip let out a vaguely threatening remark, inhaled deeply,
  bent forward towards Newt and blew onto him.
Thalia immediately started pulling Grip back by his suit,
as Newt backed off slowly.
"*A genius move, a wondrous decision,*"
  Thalia told him off.
 "*Do you have the slightest idea what could that mean in their etiquette?*"
"[do-go]" Grip wrote and pointed to their side of the dome.
"*First point, then tell him to go anywhere.
  Imagine he just went home, what would you do then?*"
 Thalia kept telling Grip off.
"[you] [do-hold] | [we] [do-go]"
"*O-oh, nice, 'we' includes us now. Put your hand back,*"
 Thalia's mood swung back.
Grip obliged and Newt carefully climbed his hand.
After the softest, smoothest walk of Grip's entire life,
Newt was held in front of the air tube for more dignified
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
[sky']
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
touching on its own terms.
He moved his head in and out of the air stream.
"*I think he likes it,*" Thalia commented.
Newt clicked and rattled in response to that,
and, one long walk later, was brought back to the sand.
"[I] | [understand]" he wrote,
 and then dispensed a cryptic "[can-not] [hold'] | [can] [hold']"

Grip considered this a victory,
but the very next column has wiped the smile off his face:
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[yous] [do-hold-?] [purpose'] | [do-explain] [purpose'] [yours-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Oh, here goes who-knows-what again,*" he vented.
"*What is this one again? 'Target'?*" Thalia asked in a worrying tone.
"*No, 'purpose'. 'Usefulness'.*"
"*Like*, goal? What's our goal?"
"No-- almost, but the other way. Our purpose. To them."
"He's asking us what do they want?"
Newt turned his head between them as they spoke.
There was no good answer.

"[I] [understand-not] [aforementioned'] | [I] [hold-not] [purpose']"
"[hold] | [purpose']"
"Good news, everybody. Everything has its purpose,"
 Thalia snarked melancholically.
"Don't forget to bring yours next time," Grip snarked back.
"[you] [want] [object'-?] | [do-explain] [category'] [object-of]"
"[purpose] | [be-object-not]"
"[you] [want] [help'] [ours-of] | [ours] [want] [help'] [yours']"
Newt just stared at them, which could mean anything.

"Change the subject," Thalia came off tense and uneasy.
"What?"
"Just trust me, OK? This is bad."
"[you] [want] [food'-?]" Grip took a shot in the dark.
"[ours] [hold] [food']"
"[food] | [be-many-?]"
"[food] [be-many] [ours] [be-many]
|[food] [be-many-not] [ours] [be-many-not]"
"[you] [want-?] | [food'] [be-many]" Grip hoped that he found a way to help.
"[true-not]"
What could be the most important conversation of the day turned into a dead-end.

"[do-go] [do-hold] [purpose']" Newt was at it again.
"*Go there, I don't know where, // Bring me that, I don't know what.*"
 Grip complained again.
"*Change the subject, now,*" Thalia was not amused.

"[I] [understand-not] [purpose'] | [I] [show] [animal']" Grip wrote,
 exciting no less than three rounds of running.
"[you] | [be-proper]" Newt praised him. At least that felt like a praise.
"Good," Thalia commended him as well.
"Now we know I'm proper. Not so sure about you though,"
 Grip joked in a tired voice.

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[do-explain] | [be-proper']" Thalia requested.
"[I] [show] | [you] [do-aforementioned]" Newt explained readily.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Waited out a pause and, seeing no hands move, added:
"[aforementioned] [be-proper]"
"I tell you what's proper, you do what's proper, and that'd be proper?"
 Thalia thought out loud.
"Obeying is proper," Grip shook his head. "No--"
"Following rules is proper," Thalia stated.
"--commanding is proper."
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[be-news-not] | [be-proper-?]" Grip inquired.
"[exist-?] [be-news-not'] [be-proper]" Newt evaded the question.
"[you] [be-proper-?] | [I] [be-proper-?]"
"[true] | [true]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

It got so dark again,
Grip could no longer afford to ignore the tail movements and rattling.
And it was during that double
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
[true],
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
when the link between these two has clicked for him. It was so simple, really.
Click-click, sideswipe-sideswipe, long curvy downwards rumble.
Or an upwards rumble. So, a forward rumble.
Anyway, Grip now knew how the written form of [true] defined its sound.
Not like he could pronounce it though.
Maybe he could tell it apart from the rest, maybe not,
there were just too many of them to confuse it with.
Like, say, [true-not].

That brought him to change the subject. Sounds!
"[you] [want-?] [know'] [sounds'] [ours-of]
"[true]" Newt waved its tail.
"[I] [show] [sounds]
|[do-show] [be-different-?] [be-different-not-?]"
Newt waited patiently.
"*'B', 'P'. 'B', 'P'. 'B', 'P'.*"
"[be-different]" Newt concluded after a pause.
"*'G', 'K'. 'G', 'K'. 'G', 'K'.*"
"[be-different]"
"*Wait, no,*" Thalia interrupted them. "*Repeat after me. 'EE'. 'EE'. 'EE'*."
"*'EE'. 'EE'. 'EE'.*"
"[be-different-not]" Newt wrote to the other side.
"*Yay! Take that,*" Thalia laughed victoriously.

It wasn't a smooth sailing for Newt:
while he was improving, say,
the '*Z--S*' distinction just didn't work for him no matter what.
But is it really that important?
Happy for advancing science, Grip put down his paper,
and, suddenly, the tables have turned.
"[I] [show] [sounds'] | [you] [show] [be-different'-?]"
 rattling and clicking, Newt started an exam of its own.
Grip did his best, not rewarded with a single hint on how he's doing.
Though, to be fair, neither did he provide any feedback to Newt.
"[I] [know-?] [be-different'-?]" Grip asked in the end.
"[true]" Newt's reply was terse.
"*So we will speak one day, you and me...*"
As usual, Newt listened to the words carefully,
while, obviously, understanding none of them.

"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [here-in] [I'] [exist] [here-in] [I']"
 Newt wrote in two columns at once.
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[exist-not] [here-in] [we'] [exist] [here-in] [we']"
 Grip completed the ritual,
 lagging behind with his column-by-column writing.
"[do-go] [do-hold] [purpose'] | [do-go] [do-hold] [animal']"
 Newt placed his order and left.

"Whew," Thalia broke her long silence. "What are you gonna bring him?"
@... pick up everything, but the star; take a sip from the bottle first ...
"A fish," Grip revealed his plan.
"A fish? Why?"
"Because it's safe... you know... aquarium."
"Huh. Makes sense, I guess."

"*What does he want us to bring? That 'purpose'.*"
"*If only I knew,*" Thalia paused putting on her suit for a moment.
 "*I don't like it. At all. This is gonna pose a problem.*"
"*He wants us to help them. Help with what?*"
"*Do you think they need our help? They seem to fare just fine.*"
"*Well, if they do, I'm all for helping.*"

The outer door hissed open, revealing another surprise:
a large, adult lizard froze in their way, staring at them.
When Grip decided to resolve the stand-off and flank it,
indicating "I see you, I want to go around you" with all his body language,
the lizard just burrowed into the sand and left.
They walked around that place anyway.

Their evening reception at the station got less grandiose.
There was no screen with Dan and Lee this time,
Irakli Kosmovich was missing as well.
"How's it going, night owls?" Lisa asked.
"Fine, mostly fine," Thalia replied.
"What's the matter?"
"Newt is asking us, what are we here for."
"And what can we help with," Grip added.
"And... what do they need our help with?" Stalina Filantievna inquired.
"That's the big question," Thalia sighed. "And fish is not the answer."
"Fish?" Stalina Filantievna frowned.
"Yeah, about that... We need a fish," Grip addressed Maria.
"I-- I'll think about that. You wanna bring him a fish?" she repeated.
"Yes. He wanted to see real animals. We should start with a fish."
"That's... not a simple request," Maria worried about something.
"What's the problem?" Thalia mirrored her tone.
"Not a particularly fish-friendly planet we've... they've got here..."
 Maria replied absentmindedly.
 "OK, I'll come up with something tomorrow, and, yeah, thanks for the heads-up.
  There must be some of them, th-- errr, sorry, what's that?"
"A piece of cactus. With some sand on it. I think. And my hand.
 Could you, please, scan it?"
"This piece of a cactus?"
"And my hand," Grip repeated.
 "Newt sat on it. And I've carried him around the dome."
"OK, you can explain it all on the way."
Thalia also kept them company.

Grip deposited the cactus into one of the containers,
while Thalia explained it's not the palm that should be scanned, but the wrist.
Maria slowly waved her hand scanner along the entire arm,
only to declare there's nothing unusual or dangerous detected.

Back in the hallway, Grip spoke up quietly:
"*We also need to discuss how--*"
"*Let's deal with it tomorrow,*"
  Thalia interrupted him rudely, only to pull him by his hand.
They went to the showers in silence,
where she turned on the tap and started washing her hands.
Once Grip followed suit, she added, barely audible over the running water:
"*I'll come up with a way to talk. And what to do,*"
@... turned off the tap, wished him good night and ran away.

Grip wandered slowly to his room.
The Epsilon Indi 3 day duration was killing him.
Just staring past his phone and gathering his thoughts was exhausting enough.
Writing a report? That's simply not--
Hmph! Don't you dare roll down again, you naughty pencil.
What if we prop you up with a phone...
