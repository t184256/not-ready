# (Not) resolved
<!-- ltex: language=en-GB -->

Can a lowly intercivilizational contactee
ever get a good night of sleep on this planet?!
This morning he was unceremoniously poked in the ribs with a finger,
right before catching a glimpse of Thalia running away.
Sigh. The phone can wait then.

Grip headed directly to the canteen, exchanged greetings with Irakli Kosmovich
in the hallway, and arrived in time to witness some dramatic scene.
Lisa was the centrepiece of it, lying on the sofa,
staring blankly at the brightly shining ceiling,
as if she was mourning the untimely demise of the world as we know it.
Distracting her from this tragic idleness
was Thalia annoying Stalina Filantievna in full swing:
"--t I'm a kid! Are you familiar with the concept?..."
She held something white, multilayered and heavily perforated under her arm,
something that hindered her gesticulation greatly.
"... I need to frolic, play, do sports. Not sit in a coop all day...
 and then on sand all night."
"No way. Decorations are on the list, decorations are approved."
"The list, the list! Don't be a machine, come up with something!
 What can I help you with? Assemble stuff? Move things?"
"I've just finished the remodelling, so, none of that."
"Then call me once something else comes up..."
 Thalia sounded progressively more desperate.
Grip poured himself a first glass of water.
"Look, I don't know," Stalina waived her arms in exasperation.
 "Since you've got a suit, you can be the next one to clean the panels."
"Thank you, thank you! Wanna come with me, Grip?"
"I didn't mean right now, they're not--"
Grip wasn't in the mood to feign enthusiasm:
"Please, have some mercy. I just woke up, what panels..."
"Yeah, sure, text me when you're free, OK, thank you!"
 she barraged him, already running away.
Stalina Filantievna shook her head and
began to unload her pockets of plenty into the drawers and onto the shelves.

Back in his room, Grip checked the phone.
An audio from mom.
In a cheerful voice,
she told him she had signed up for all the expeditions she could,
and got too lazy to cook for herself.
Asked to warn her in advance when he's coming back,
so that she cancels everything to be at home.
Dropped what was probably a hot piece of local news,
Dima Seleznyov breaking his toe against a goalpost;
but this only made Grip feel more distanced
from this faraway normal life of his that he lived and breathed just last week.
She also mentioned that she saw his speech
(one from the Palace of Reconnaissance, presumably),
but didn't show it to anyone else.
And concluded with a sudden
@"hope you're not bored there, science can be boring at times".
It took an effort for Grip to lower his eyebrow back
and shake off that last comment,
but he once again opted to not tell anything of importance
until he's told it's all declassified.
So he promised her that when he'll come back,
they'll bake an oven full of cherry pastry together;
that the video probably wasn't that great to begin with,
so she was right about not showing it to anybody;
and that science is being handled by the real scientists,
while he's just helping them a little.

He then went to the shower,
bumped into Thalia on the way back,
got cornered and badgered into joining her solar panel cleaning.

They put on their planet suits, left the ship and went around it along its wall.
The ship's side featured a pod docked to it,
the outside of it looking criminally ugly and boring
for something capable of flying to the orbit right away.
Grip just couldn't wait until it stopped blocking the view
and revealed a field of solar panels
almost the size of the ship itself.
The panels stood on thin legs, less than a meter high,
each one of them tilted slightly to the left.
And there was a cactus: green, plump, higher than the panels,
spikeless and heavily chewed up.

Once he was done with the sightseeing,
Thalia caught his glance and flicked her wrist,
producing two long soft brushes out of thin air.
As Grip approached her to grab one,
she unfastened and unsealed the hood-helmet just a bit.
He hesitated for a moment, then followed her lead.
The bitter air filled his lungs, but he could hear so much better now.
"*What do you think, can Stalina hear us here?*"
"*I don't know, really.*"

They went along the panel rows, brushing something dust- or sand-like off them.
Not like there was nothing to swipe off,
but it was unlikely to seriously impede the panels' performance either.

"*Are you gonna get in trouble? If they find out.*"
"*We're the ones formally in charge here, not them.*"
"*Are we?*" Grip wondered.
"*At least I rank higher, that's for sure.*"
"*And...*" Grip trailed off. "*Why beg for a ball then? If you can just order.*"
"*Don't get in my way of forging relationships,*"
 Thalia laughed and sealed up, and so did Grip, eagerly breathing in good air.

"*OK, let's make an agreement,*" Thalia said a couple of rows later.
 "*No bringing him in, unless we both agree.
   No admitting it, unless we both agree.*"
"*Deal,*" Grip said in the most serious tone he could muster.
"*So, I thought about it, and I can smuggle him in,
  but only if he... coope--... sits tight and does nothing stupid!*"
Grip involuntarily glanced at her left hand, as if she was going to flick
her wrist and spin a frozen, wide-eyed Newt between her fingers.
"*Bad idea,*" he shook his head.
 "*That's gonna end with us chasing him all around the base.
   I also thought, and-- We need a cage.*"
"*Where are we supposed to find a cage?*
"*We tell them he asked for a lizard. And a lizard needs a cage.*"
"*Brilliant!*" Thalia admired him.
 "*So simple!
   Wait, no. What are we gonna do with the other one? Leave it in the dome?*"
"*Yeah... poor lizard. So we're gonna chase the other one around the dome.*"
"*A secret compartment? Under the lid or something?*"
"*What? No. That also is a bad idea.*"
"*Whatever, we can iron out the kinks later,*" Thalia ended up optimistic.
They sealed up again.

Another two rows later, Grip suddenly noticed a large lizard
peeking from the underside of one of the panels.
Grip waved a brush at it; the lizard waved nothing in return.
Unsure how to proceed, he just cleaned the row as usual;
and the lizard simply retracted itself out of sight once he got closer.

"*Maybe market it as an adventure?*" Thalia resumed the conversation.
"*Better stress the safety. Including from complex objects.*"
"*Well... yeah... What I meant, I think he's a teen,
  like, he totally acts like one. Tries to dare us.
  We need to flip it around. Become cooler. Turn a dare into a favour.*"
"*If we end up doing what he wants, is there-- Never mind. There is.*"
"*You know what, if they have leaders,
  the previous contact group was likely talking to their leaders.
  But if Newt is a teen, is he a teen leader? Just a teen?*"
"*A trained diplomat,
  or a random teen who just wanted to learn an alien language?*"
Thalia snorted, but Grip's hood prevented him from noticing.
"*I don't know,*" he continued.
 "*That kinda assumes they have leaders in the first place.*"
"*OK, next thing, why aren't adults proper?*"
"*No, that's something we can discuss at the base,
  with Irakli Kosmovich.*"
Grip sealed up again.
That was the last phrase of the walk;
they completed the cleaning and went back in silence, scheming.

Back at the base, Grip made a tough decision to start with the hard part:
the report.
Just like the last time, he focused on the visit to the dome,
and not on what was happening at the base.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
He detailed his main contribution to science so far:
the [juice] sign that was both blood and sky juice now;
briefly reported on the fruitless search for [purpose']...
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip divulged nothing on the daring sleepover plan, obviously,
but decided to make Thalia happier and left a request at the very end:
 "*We're working hard, and sometimes we want to have fun.
   Could the soccer balls' accounting be simplified somehow?*"

Next he visited Maria.
"... most importantly, this one comes from really hot Faina mountain springs,
 so, at least after sunset, we don't have to bother with cooling at all.
 Just give it food and oxygen--"
"I get it. That's nice, really. Why. Is it. So. Ugly?"
"You only think so, because your brain is wired to stay away from carnivores.
 I mean, you see these teeth, you know it can bite you hard,
 so you're subconsciously cautious of them.
 But that's just you.
 Since no one eats local lizards,
 I can guarantee you, they don't share your views."
"Uhh..."
"Think of it, why are you uneasy about carnivores?
 You're not gonna let it bite Newt anyway, are you?"
"No, of course not, but still...
 Those hot streams, do any other fish live there?"
"Oh, sure they do. Say, the ones it preys on, give me a second..."
"Yeah, like this! Much nicer."
"It's, like, half your size," Maria spoke softly.
 "Add water, and it's way too heavy to be carried anywhere."
"And this one?"
"Like, this long, so, much more manageable. Just a large bottle, basically."
Grip caved in with a sigh.

Irakli Kosmovich was checking out something on his phone,
and Grip didn't want to startle him.
"*Hello?*"
"*Come in, come in. Time for maths?*"
"*Maths?*"
"*Algebra. According to the reports,
  you've been studying Russian for two days straight,*" he winked.
 "*But, I guess, it's time for you to study for real.*"
"*Yeah, just a few lizard questions first. What's...*"
  he scribbled down "[do-hold-?]". "... this one?"
"*Interrogative-imperative mood. Nothing special, really.
  We don't have it in such a pure form, but compare it with ours
  'would you rather study algebra?'.
  Consider it a 'have it, would you?'*"
"*Aha, OK. Could you also explain, how should we understand this one?*"
  Grip wrote down "[be-proper]".
"*Look, that's the one you've explained just fine the other day.
  We used to treat it as 'good', then, as the discrepancies accumulated,
  we've compromised on 'proper'.*"
"*I'm afraid I need more. I need to understand it better.*"
"*OK, their concepts don't have to map unambiguously to ours.
  But I can tell you for sure,
  this denotes what's something socially acceptable in their culture...
  following the 'plan', the 'scheme' thing, that will be 'proper'.
  Yet that's not all to it.*"
"*What else? If one takes something by force, would that be 'proper'?*"
"*I don't think so, I'd go with 'strong',*"
  Irakli Kosmovich jotted down "[be-strong]"
"*Yeah, I know... Can 'proper' mean 'principal'?*"
"*No, and that's way too narrow.*"
"*We're not gonna get far this way.
  Can I have examples with it? When they call various things 'proper'?*"
"*Sure, I...*" Irakli Kosmovich scrambled for a second.
 "*Look, how about I do it later? That'd take some time.*"
"*OK, let's do algebra.*"

Irakli Kosmovich explained how to remove brackets to arrive at polynomials,
which was much more straightforward and understandable than lizard.
And so was factoring back out.
Algebra wasn't paper-worthy:
Irakli Kosmovich came up with more and more problems on his phone,
Grip solved them on his.
Some examples factored nicely, others were a mess,
leaving him to wonder whether he's done everything correctly.
Irakli Kosmovich has somehow digressed from polynomials and onto
Picts and other Celts factoring some things and distributing others,
eventually leaving Welsh in a messy state ---
an impromptu lecture
that Grip was about a decade of studies short from understanding in full,
yet he found it enjoyable in an abstract way. Also, "Picts" sounded funny.

In the midst of it, Thalia ran in and frowned, ill-tempered:
"*Why haven't you called me?*"
Grip began to defend himself, claiming he didn't promise to.
They quickly went over [do-hold-?] and [be-proper] again,
and then he sent her off to Maria to check on the fish,
since Thalia hasn't seen it yet.

A few problems later, he joined them as well.
Thalia and Maria were in sorrow over a grotesque colourful blob on the screen,
drifting and slowly morphing in a trippy manner.
"What happened? This one is even worse."
"Yeah, no way," Maria ruled and returned the previous picture.
 "Round bottles are out."
Turns out, they've decided to simulate how Newt will see the fish,
and it was a disaster. Vertical bottles would be bad for checking out
from the ground level, and round bottles distorted the fish
into a nightmare fuel that even humans had a hard time reconstructing back.
Grip was against a large horizontal rectangular bottle with a wide side cap,
but Thalia and Maria insisted this was the best idea so far.
When asked:
"If we make it this large, just how is it supposed to turn around?"
Grip mumbled:
"Make it just enough to turn around.
 *It's a tough life for everyone, myself included,*"
 and left to roam the base alone and get familiar with it at last.

The far side, one past the teleports, wasn't in use,
and so was half of this side as well,
its sections packed with mysterious equipment.
Grip found Thalia's room, with tall white perforated paper-like figurines.
Other rooms were hard to match with people,
though Irakli's room had papers on the bedside table.
And another one turned out to be Maria's,
when he was passing it for the third time, and found her sitting on the bed.

The canteen featured Dramatic Lisa once again.
"Why are you so sad?" Grip asked. "Did something happen?"
"No-o," she stretched out. "I'm not sad. I'm just bored.
 I'm bored because I have nothing to do."
"And what do you do? Usually."
"I'm studying how planets become... the way they are now.
 Like a historian, but for very slow, astronomically slow processes?
 Where did all the sand come from?.. Where are the oceans?..."
Grip didn't have the heart to tell her to speak like he was ten, not five.
"... have there ever been any oceans? This kind of questions."
"And what is special about this planet?"
"Nothing! That's the thing, nothing is.
 There's another planet just like this one, Gamma Echo 6,
 one we've discovered long ago, studied it down to the tiniest details,
 and it's very, very similar in almost all the aspects.
 No axial tilt, no seasons, no weather, no water, just a stupid giant desert.
 No lizards, by the way, but it's also not as old as Epsilon Indi 3,
 so, maybe we should just give it time...
 That is beyond what I'm supposed to study though.
 So, I already wrote everything I could about this planet, and yeah,
 the amount of times I've started a sentence with 'just like Gamma Echo 6'..."
"It's better when you're in school.
 You get questions, you need to give answers."
"Exactly, and after school you need to come up with your own questions.
 And I've run out of questions."
"Is there nothing else here? For you to study?"
"Well, I'm supposed to study the other planets of this system as well.
 But they're even more boring,
 and, most crucially, I don't have the equipment for that.
 I might be the closest astrophysicist to them, yes,
 but even the telescope here is a total joke,
 not to mention everything else I would need for that.
 I did what I could, but..."
"Can you ask for a bigger one?"
"I did, but they don't approve it. I would need a pretty large one,
 and they also know the other planets are boring."
"So, what are you supposed to study?"
"I don't know!" she uttered bitterly. "That's the thing."
"I don't know either," Grip backed off slightly and tried to speak softly.
 "Have you told this to your... boss?"
"Of course I had."
"... Have you tried not sending them reports at all?"
"Guess what, that's exactly my strategy right now," she smirked.
"Write them a long final report," Grip suggested.
 "Put together everything you've already written."
"And top it off with a large red line," Lisa snorted.
 "I'M DONE WITH THIS. TAKE ME HOME."
"Yeah, like this."
"Eh, sorry, Grip, I didn't mean to belittle your idea,
 it's actually, not a bad idea after all.
 It's gonna be real boring though, compiling it...
 But it would be harder for them to 'continue observations' me back
 if I sent them a... a final report.
 Thank you, I'll definitely consider this.
 And if you find out something about lizard cities, tell me,"
 she changed the subject abruptly.
"Is this... astrophysics?" Grip wondered.
"No. I'm just being curious. They gotta live somewhere...
 Listen, if they do send me back at last,
 what other expert would you rather have instead?"
"I don't know," Grip protested.
 "I have no idea, really. I'm here for only two days."
"OK, fair."
And she returned to the same pose she was in before.

Back in his room,
Grip attempted to write "[be-proper]" on his thin blanket with a finger,
trying to hit it the way Newt parted sand with his tail.
The blanket was no sand, though. Dip his tail in something? Give him a pencil?
Nah, it'd be easier to learn their speech--
Speech! He forgot to tell Irakli Kosmovich that Newt understood their speech!

The piece of news didn't resonate with the old linguist the way Grip hoped for.
It felt like he was so entrenched in a thought it just couldn't be that way,
that he was unnecessarily stubborn and asking to re-check just in case.
And unreasonably happy about "sibilants" being indistinguishable after all,
even though, like, what a tiny nuance is this?
Irakli Kosmovich asked Grip once again to not overwhelm Newt
with sentences and the like, and stick to simple distinct words.
Finally, he apologized for not gathering the examples yet:
 "*I've searched the transcripts,
   but now I'll have to skim through the declassified ones only.*"

Time has almost run out.
Grip went to Maria to check on the fish, and found it doubly hideous in person.
The bottle was rather small indeed,
the air tab let out a thin stream of bubbles.
Thalia proudly presented him some flimsy deflector for glow sticks
that "guys from above" had helped her design.

The sun was already setting down.
They hurried to the dome,
got out of their suits,
rushed through the inner doors,
and that was when Newt dropped on Thalia's head from above.

Grip didn't see the fall itself,
only caught a glimpse of Newt on her back,
clinging onto the collar of her suit,
before Thalia turned to give Grip a thoughtful, detached look.
It felt like they were writing a test, locked eyes, and she signalled him
@"give me a hint!".
And then, a second later, she screamed and ran away.

Grip tried to chase them and help, but, with his very first movement,
realized he's holding a fish tank.
So there was nothing else left for him,
but to lower it carefully onto the glass floor,
watching Thalia run away and Newt bounce frantically against her back.
@"*Hold on, stand still!*"
he shouted, surprised that his words had an effect.
As soon as he freed up his arms, he rushed to them,
grabbed Newt across the body with both hands,
quickly detached him and put him on the glass.
Newt immediately ran to the centre, rejoicing,
and Thalia headed to the side, where the water tank was.

Fuming and scolding them both with all the linguistic means at his disposal,
Grip followed Newt to the centre.
"[exist] [here-in-?] [we'] | [exist] [sun-in-?] [we']"
awaited him.
Grip swiftly replied with his hands slightly shaking:
"[do-hold] [substance'] [sun-of] | [do-go] [do-hold] [here']"
As Newt ran away to fetch the glowing star, Grip inscribed a large "[do-wait]",
inhaled deeply and walked briskly towards Thalia.

She sat on the glass with her back against the wall.
"*What's got into you?*" he addressed her from the distance.
 "*Running, screaming...*"
"*... acting like a normal kid--*"
  she raised her head, eyes glinting with mischief.
"*Brilliant, why are you all so brilliant?*" he blurted out.
"*--just like you asked me to?*" she shifted responsibility.
"*OK, we're coming back to make amends then, so, sit here.*"

Newt waited for him, a star-- ... It was no Newt!
Grip blinked in disbelief, but no,
he watched him up close for two evenings straight,
and this, this was a different lizard.
Yes, a small one, even smaller than Newt. A different one.
"[you] | [be-new-?]" Grip wrote, realizing mid-phrase
 that it could be interpreted in at least three distinct ways.
"[I] [be-new] | [you] [be-new]"
"[go] [here'] [be-first] | [go] [here'] [be-second]" Grip insisted.
"[aforementioned] [can] | [go'] [here']"
"What?"
Newt just watched him calmly over a star in his mouth.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[you] [be-first] [go] [ours'] | [you] [be-second-?] [go] [ours']"
"[true-not]"
"[you] [be-different-?]"
"[I] [be-one] | [I] [be-different-not]
"*Do you shed skin or what?*" Grip asked aloud.
Newt stared at him the way he always stared at any source of human sounds.
"[you] [be-different-not-?] [inside-in]
|[you] [be-different-?] [outside-in]"
"[true]"

Grip thought for long enough for Newt to gain initiative:
"[exist-not] [here-in] | [be-second'] [yous-of]" he stated.
"[aforementioned] [think] [you'] [be-danger]"
"[I] [be-danger-?] | [exist-not] [danger']"
Grip erupted:
"[exist] [up-in] [you'] [you] [go] [down']
|[aforementioned] [be-proper-not] [aforementioned] [be-danger]..."
 he wrote in long columns all the way up to Newt.
"[aforementioned] [be-proper] | [aforementioned] [be-danger-not]"
 Newt objected without waiting for him to finish.
"[danger]" Grip wrote as one large sign, caught his breath and continued:
"[you] [go] [down'] [exist] [down-in] [you']
|[you] [can-not] [go'] [can] [exist-not'] [you']"
"[I] [be-new] [be-strong] | [I] [can] [go']" Newt objected.
"[exist] [up-in] [you'] [you] [go] [down'] [we-in] [be-danger]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip wrote in one ridiculously long column,
erasing the previous writing with the other hand.
Newt stared at him, as he nailed it with a second column:
"[exist] [up-in] [you'] [you] [go] [down'] [we-in-not] [be-danger-er]"
and, to illustrate the risks better, knocked his knuckles against the glass.
Now that argument punctured Newt's defensive arrogance alright,
he even dropped the star and ran around a little to internalize the blow,
as if it actually was the first time he considered
the consequences of missing his victim.
"*I was told you're sentient. Think,*" Grip gloated.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[true]" Newt admitted once he finished running.
"[you] [go] [down'] [we-in] | [you] [go] [down'] [we-in-not]"
 Grip cemented his victory of common sense over recklessness.
 "[you] | [know-not]".
"[true]" Newt waved his tail hesitantly, then continued:
"[down-in] [yours-of] [be-danger-er]
|[down-in] [ours-of] [be-danger-er-not]"
"*That's better. We can work with that. Now let's go make peace with Thalia.*
 [do-go]"
"[do-go] | [do-hold]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->

"*It's your turn now!..." Grip began addressing her on approach.
  Tell this kamikaze to refrain from suicide, against us or against glass.*"
"*Remember how I've considered bringing--*"
"*Yeah.*"
"*--I take it back. No way. Cage or it ain't happening.*"
"*Yeah. Indeed...*"
Grip put Newt down onto the sand nearby.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[you] [be-danger]" Thalia crawled and wrote towards him.
"[I] | [be-danger-not]"
"[do-go-not] [down'] [I-in]"
"[I] [go-not] [down'] [yours-of]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"[be-proper]" she pretended to accept his non-apology,
and stood up to walk to the centre.
Newt followed her on foot,
Grip took it as an opportunity to pick up the long-forgotten fish.

The fish just sort of floated in place, barely moving its fins,
and still fascinated Newt to no end.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[aforementioned] [can] [go] [up-in]
|[I] [can-?] [hold'] [aforementioned']" he asked after a long while.
"*I don't get it, does he want to take it from us or just touch it?*"
 Thalia wondered.
Grip dismissed her question as a rhetorical one:
Newt could neither be trusted with a fish, nor touch it.
"[you] [can-not] [hold'] | [exist] [juice'] [sky-of]"
"[can-not-?] [exist'] [inside-in] [I']"
"[can-not] [exist'] [inside-in] [you']
|[can-not] [exist'] [outside-in] [aforementioned']"
"[I] [want] [hold'] [aforementioned']"
"[you] [can-not] [hold'] [aforementioned']
|[you] [can] [see'] [aforementioned']"
"[I] | [understand]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Once the initial fascination wore off, Newt became more and more active.
He prodded the tank walls with his face, dug below it,
put his front legs on top of the wall to get a better view and then
swiftly climbed onto the top.
The fish shied away from him, which only made him more agitated.

That gave Grip an idea.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[do-go] | [I']" he wrote and put his hand between the signs.
As Newt climbed the hand, Grip slowly turned it over.
Newt fell off onto the sand and stared at the hand, befuddled.
"[exist] [down'] [up-in] | [you] [can] [go']" Grip wrote.
"[living place] [be-?#3?] | [you] [be-?#3?-not]"
Grip jotted down the sign.
"[do-explain] [be-?#3?]"
"[can] [go'] [?#3?'] | [can-not] [go'] [you']"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Smooth, I presume,*" Thalia concluded.

Grip toppled his water bottle and pointed onto it.
When Newt climbed it, Grip started turning the bottle around.
Newt held to it even if lifted and turned upside down.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[substance] | [be-?#3?-?]" Grip clarified.
"[true]"

"[I] [go-?] | [living place-in] [sun-of]" Newt asked.
Grip circled the "[living place-in] [sun-of]".
"[living place-in] [sleep-of] [yours-of]" Newt clarified.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"*Should we?...*" Grip trailed off, unsure whether they were listened to.
"*Caged up, of course,*"
 Thalia reminded with a dash of eerie vengeance in her voice.
 "*Not a finger sticking out.*"
Grip nodded in solidarity. Newt's stunt was all the convincing he needed.
That was generous of him to pull it off in advance.
"*Just looking, no interaction, no escapades, there and back, nothing more,*"
 Thalia continued.
 *And if that's not what he hopes for, too bad.*"
"*Sounds boring. He'll probably want more than just looking,*"
  Grip stated dryly.
"*Not my problem. Now make it crystal clear, I know you can.*"

<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[you] [want-?] [see'] [animal'] [ours-of] [be-different-not] [you']"
"[true]" Newt was tip-toeing, ready to run in circles again.
"[you] [want] [go] [ours']
|[we] [think] [you'] [be-danger]"
Newt didn't even argue.
"[exist] [up-in] [sun'] [exist] [down-in] [sun']
|[we] [go] [hold] [animal'] [be-different-not] [you']"
Newt gave in and ran a lap before replying:
"[you] [be-proper]"
"[you] [be-proper] [exist] [here-in] [animal'] [you] [go] [ours']"
Newt went for a second lap, but Grip continued:
"[you] [be-proper-not] [you] [go-not] [ours'] [animal] [go] [ours']"
"*Crystal clear indeed,*" Thalia commented approvingly.
"[I] | [be-proper]" Newt either promised or just reminded.
"[you] [be-danger] [you] [go] [yours']
|[you] [be-danger-not] [you] [go] [ours']" Grip continued.
"[I] [be-proper]
|[I] [be-danger-not]" Newt replied.
"[we] [want] [you] [go] [you] [go]
|[we] [want-not] [you] [go-not] [you] [go-not]"
.Thalia entered the conversation.
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
Grip extended his hand to add the missing antestrokes,
but changed his mind midway
and erased four duplicate signs from the ends of her columns instead.
"[I] | [understand]" Newt assured them.
"*Happy?*" Grip asked Thalia.
"*As good as it gets...*" she replied reluctantly.
 "*I like what he says, but I've... developed trust issues.*"

Grip hesitated as well, scrambling for words.
<!-- ltex: enabled=false -->
"[we] [go] [hold] | [animal'] [inside] [object-of]"
"[true]"
<!-- ltex: enabled=true -->
"How do you..." Grip frowned, then followed Newt's gaze to the fish tank.
"[exist] [be-many] [living place-in] [ours-of] [objects'] [be-complex]
|[exist] [inside-in] [object-of] [exist-not] [outside-in] [you']"
 he compiled a syntactically questionable explanation.
"[exist] [object-in] [I'] | [exist] [living place-in] [object']"
 Newt either agreed or clarified the proper sign usage.
"[exist] [inside-in] [you'] | [exist] [outside-in] [objects'] [be-complex]"
 Grip didn't know how to align the columns and gave up.
"[I] | [understand]"
Thalia tapped the "we don't want, you don't go" again,
Newt wagged his tail above the "I understand".
"*I hope we're clear.*"
"*So do I.*"

While Thalia set up her new illumination device,
Grip took a break to stretch and drink.
They then spent the rest of the evening teaching Newt English.
The word selection turned out to be of great importance.
It's all fun and games when the only words you know is
"wait" ([do-wait]) and "go" ([do-go]), but then a "no" ([true-not]),
puts a spanner in the works. Phrases like "I go" were peanuts to him,
<!-- align: [I] [go] -->
but an overheard "no you" almost made his little head explode.
At least Newt overhearing their casual conversations
was not something to worry about.

At some point Newt initiated the elaborate goodbye sequence
and ran away with the glowing star,
requiring nothing this time and not teaching them any sounds in return.
Grip and Thalia started packing up as well.

"*So?*" Grip asked the most important question.
"*I haven't made up my mind yet. But let's prepare.
  Who knows what else he pulls off...
  At least he's done questioning us on the purpose thing.*"
"*Good*", Grip admitted uneasily.

"*If we're bringing a lizard here next time,*"
  Grip began voicing his concerns carefully, while struggling with his sleeve,
  "*We'll also have to think about food and water--*"
"*Why, yes, of course, we'll need some.*"
"*OK, just something to keep in mind...*"
  Grip didn't like something about this part of the plan,
  or any other part of the plan, for that matter,
  but he wasn't able to put it into words in time for them to seal the hoods.

On the way back, Grip couldn't shake off the feeling that
lizards are there, to the side of their path, watching them.
But the upgraded glow stick in Thalia's hand was more of a hindrance than help,
the planet suit dampened all the sounds,
so maybe it was just his imagination.
Yesterday he was sure, today --- not so much.

Back at the base, Thalia took the fish and Grip went to the canteen alone.
Today there were just Maria and Stalina --- either the curiosity waned off,
or they came back extremely late today.

"Hello!" they put down their phones. "What's new?"
"Next time we want a lizard, something similar to him."
"I've been waiting for that," Maria replied.
"Have you?"
"Yes, I knew you'd ask for it. It was about time. Yeah, so...
 OK, I already know which one to print."
"It's only logical that, out of all our animals,
 Newt would be most interested in those most similar to them,"
 Stalina reasoned.
 "But I'd really love to hear that this would put an end
  to our station gradually turning into a zoo.
  And someone would have to care about that lizard."
"I will," Grip assured her. "And Thalia takes the fish."
"OK then," she relented, "We can have a second animal."
"We'll need a large cage," Grip added.
 "And a larger aquarium for the fish, I guess."
"Yeah," Maria replied, deep in her thoughts. "Something to figure out tomorrow."
"I'll help you with the cage," Thalia appeared out of thin air.
 "Do lizards shed skin?"
"Yes, sweetie, all the time, just like you," Maria replied absentmindedly.
"Me?!" Thalia raised her hands to look at them. "Ew."
"Their scales do fall off, yes, profusely, even,
 but not the way you probably had in mind.
 Don't expect them gifting you a lizard-sized skin cocoons,"
 Maria awakened from her thoughts.
 "And they're not lizards.
  Why are you asking? Did you see Newt shedding?"
"No, I just... when I saw him today, he looked different from yesterday,"
 Grip replied instead of Thalia.
"Different in?..."
"Body."
"Huh. He's still young, isn't he?.. Yeah. Sorry. No idea."
"Today Newt has climbed my suit as well," Thalia changed the topic gleefully.
"Good, sounds like you're having fun," Stalina Filantievna dismissed her.
 "It's pretty late, fellows, you'd better go.
  Grip, I'll come to your room in five minutes."
"Huh? What for?" he immediately went full-on suspicious.
"Why, a save point, of course. Time flies, it's been three days already."
"A say-what?" he asked, befuddled.
Stalina Filantievna looked at him expectantly,
so he turned to his partner for support.
Except she gawked at him,
as if save points were the first topic of "Special agenting 101".
But then again, if they were, Grip never got his copy.

"We'll be scanning you every three days," Stalina Filantievna explained.
 "So that if something happens to you, we can just print you back."
"But you can already print us back."
"And explain everything anew?
 We've got a diplomatic mission to run here,
 it'd be bad enough if you forgot three days of it-- all of it.
 You've got unique, valuable experience now, expertise we can't risk losing."
"Why not do it every day then?"
"Because the paralyser--"
 Stalina looked at Maria, expecting her to continue.
"Your body ain't gonna thank you for that,"
 Maria didn't want to go into the details.
 "Three is already as aggressive as it gets,
  and one really shouldn't go lower than that."

Thalia has left already, but Grip was still processing the new information.
"Should I go to the teleport then?"
"No, no need to, I can carry you there and back, no problem.
 Just go to your room and prepare for sleep.
 Once you're ready, I'll inject the paralyser.
 And then you simply wake up tomorrow morning and go on with your day,
 as if nothing happened. Sounds good?"
"Uh. OK. As you say."

Back in his room, Grip put everything in place, checked the phone.
Somehow he didn't feel like sleeping any more.
Stalina Filantievna appeared soon with a syringe in her hand:
"*Ready?*"
Grip shrugged and laid down on the bed.
Closed his eyes, then immediately decided against it.
She lowered down next to him and made an injection into his arm.
Grip's body immediately ceased to obey him...
